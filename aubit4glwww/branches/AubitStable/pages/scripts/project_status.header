<h2 align="center">Aubit project status</h2>
<hr>
<p>Last updated on 25/06/2005, by Andrej Falout</p>
<p>This page attempts to keep track on progress of various Aubit compiler 
functionality and components, and quantify there maturity. It's main goal is to 
help set appropriate level of expectations for the end user, and at the same 
time provide a common place of reference for developers. As it catalogues all 
components of the project, it may also serve as a good starting point for 
exploration, both end users and developers. For folks that prefer bullets to sentences (and therefore probably 
are not reading this anyway):</p>
<p>Purpose of this page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>keep track of progress</li>
  <li>quantify maturity</li>
  <li>set expectations</li>
  <li>common place of reference</li>
  <li>catalogue components</li>
</ul>
<p>Aubit compiler is a work in progress, and by the very nature of OpenSource 
development process, it will remain in such state for foreseeable future. This 
means that some components may be fully production ready and extensively tested, 
but some other may be not much more then a prototype. For readers unfamiliar 
with OpenSource software, this is common, if not universal occurrence. Same is 
true for most commercial software products, it is just that end user rarely has 
the chance to see any parts of internal, proprietary development process.</p>
<p>Thanks to the fully modular architecture of Aubit compiler, where practically 
all functionality is implemented in a form of plug-ins, this varying status 
levels do not have to be a cause for concern, but has to be understood. Additionally, Aubit provides a 
full automated regression tests suite of over 800 tests, so it is easy for user to 
verify functionality of all components (or only components developer wants to 
use) on every Aubit release, in less then 30 
minutes.</p>
<p>TO-DO:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Add link to current regression test results for general 4GL features 
    (Mike?)</li>
	<li>Add links to regression test result for database features/SQL for each 
	database supported (Andrej)</li>
    <li>Make this page a Wiki home page; create link for each feature/module 
    into its own Wiki page, to enable developers to easily share information 
    specific to functionality/module with users and other developers, especially 
    between the manual releases. This repositories of information will then 
    represent a base to migrate information on new functionality into the 
    manual. (Andrej)</li>
    <li>Add status for tools in tools/ directory</li>
    <li>Add list of directories to be removed or renamed/moved in CVS</li>
    <li>Create links for directories to Aubit CVS web browser interface</li>
    <li>Create links to manual or other documentation entry for it</li>
    <li>Crate links from classes of components to architecture diagram section, 
    and vice versa</li>
    <li>Group entries in this table by class (database access, user interface, 
    RPC, etc...)</li>
</ul>
