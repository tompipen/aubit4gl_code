<p align="left"><i><u>Aubit 4GL project</u></i> is a OpenSource project to make
free, GPL, Informix-4GL compatible compiler, and continue to extend
functionality needed to write most efficient, stabile and productive
applications in business related, database oriented applications.</p>

<p align="left"><i><u>Aubit 4GL compiler</u></i> is software that translates
x4GL programming language into executable programs, enabling fast and productive
creation of database oriented applications utilizing 4GL with embedded SQL and C
programming languages, using ODBC to connect to databases, and GTK+ for GUI, or
Ncurses for CUI presentation layers.</p>

<p align="left">Little bit of history:</p>

<p align="left">Long time ago, <a href="http://www.informix.com" target="_blank"> Informix</a>
(TM) (Now owned by IBM) made a Fourth Generation Language (4GL),
called Informix 4GL. It was intended to be nice language for making business process,
database oriented programming easy and productive. Some people agreed with this,
and started making applications in that language. And over the time, they made a
lot of 4gl applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">In the process, a lot of programmers find it easy to learn and use,
stabile, fast, easy to manage, and most of all, productive. So the number of
people with I-4GL skills continued growing. But, Informix was slow to respond to
increased demand for feature enhancements, most notably, GUI, or reacted in a
way that was not well accepted by users, like making a completely new product
with limited 4GL compatibility, called New Era.</p>

<p align="left">Several companies seized the opportunity, and started making
compatible compilers, and extending functionality. And Informix 4GL was no
longer in hands of one company, competition increased, feature where added at
increasing pace, and this is where we are now.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">&quot;4GL&quot; stands for &quot;Fourth Generation
Language&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><b>From <a href="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?4GL">http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?4GL</a></b><b>
:</b></p>

<p>An &quot;application specific&quot; language. The term was invented by Jim
Martin to refer to non-procedural <a href="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?high+level+language">high
level language</a>s built around <a href="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?database">database</a>
systems. The first three generations were developed fairly quickly, but it was
still frustrating, slow, and error prone to program computers, leading to the
first &quot;programming crisis&quot;, in which the amount of work that might be
assigned to programmers greatly exceeded the amount of programmer time available
to do it. Meanwhile, a lot of experience was gathered in certain areas, and it
became clear that certain applications could be generalized by adding limited
programming languages to them. Thus were born report-generator languages, which
were fed a description of the data format and the report to generate and turned
that into a <a href="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?COBOL">COBOL</a>
(or other language) program which actually contained the commands to read and
process the data and place the results on the page.
<p>Some other successful 4th-generation languages are: <a href="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?database+query+language">database

<p align="left">Informix-4GL, and therefore x4GL programming language is
&quot;English language-like&quot; programming language, which is arguably one of
its biggest strengths. General consensus is that that x4GL language is one of
easiest to learn, and make programmers productive in shortest possible time. John
McNally, author of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=informix+unleashed" target="_blank">Informix
Unleashed</a> book, say that &quot;<i>To develop with a 4gl, the developer does not have to be an expert
programmer</i>&quot;.&nbsp; We agree. For instance:</p>

<div align="left">
  <blockquote>
    <table border="0" bgcolor="#C0C0C0" width="724" height="19">
      <tr>
        <td width="714" height="13"><p align="left"><font color="#000000">OPEN
          WINDOW MyTestWindow AT 2,3 WITH FORM &quot;FormForMyTestWindow&quot;
          ATTRIBUTE( border, white )</font></p>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<p align="left">Try to guess what this will do? Try this one:</p>

<div align="left">
  <blockquote>
    <table border="0" bordercolor="#C0C0C0" bgcolor="#C0C0C0">
      <tr>
        <td><p align="left"><font color="#000000">MENU "Title for my test menu&quot;<br>
          COMMAND &quot;Impress Me&quot; "Do something to impress me&quot; help
          126<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CALL ImpressMe()<br>
          COMMAND &quot;Exit&quot; &quot;Exit this menu&quot; help 127<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EXIT MENU<br>
          END MENU</font></p>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<p align="left">One of favorite power tools in x4GL is Query By Example (QBE).
It uses forms to ask user for search criteria, and automatically forms SQL
&quot;where part&quot;:</p>

<div align="left">
  <blockquote>
    <table border="0" bgcolor="#C0C0C0">
      <tr>
        <td><p align="left"><font color="#000000">CONSTRUCT BY NAME MyWherePart
          ON AddressTable.*&nbsp;</font></p>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<p align="left">Believe it or not, that was it. If you want to learn more, see
our <a href="http://aubit4gl.sourceforge.net/aubit4gldoc/4glreference/index.htm" target="_blank">x4gl
language reference</a>. See excellent Informix 4gl tutorial &quot;<a href="http://www.informix.com/answers/english/docs/734gl/5296.pdf" target="_blank">Informix
4GL By Example</a>&quot; (PDF format) if you want to learn the language. If you
are experienced programmer, this will probably be one of easiest languages you
ever learned, and if you are just starting to write programs, this in our opinion
is you best choice.</p>

<p align="left">x4GL language allows for SQL commands to be embedded directly in
x4GL code, and Aubit 4GL allows you to embed C language code too, creating a
unique &quot;High / Low&quot; approach to programming. The fact is, Aubit 4GL
compiler is really a &quot;x4GL to C&quot; programming language
&quot;translator&quot;, and actual executable programs are compiled by standard
C compiler. To summarize, daily tasks related to creating database applications
and reports are really easy to do, but if you need to go &quot;deep down&quot;,
you can, just as if you are programming in C.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="left"><font color="#00FF00"><a name="Why is it?">Why is it?</a></font></h3>

<p align="left">It is, because despite increasing number of commercial I-4GL compiler
makers, Informix professionals where increasingly frustrated mainly by lack of
true professional
and timely support from most of commercial vendors.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">It is, because we discovered advantages of OpenSource model
development using other OpenSource software needed to make things work in our daily
jobs, and the disadvantages in getting our job done, when having to literally
beg on our knees for anything that we need from commercial companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">It is, because Internet enabled us to share not only knowledge,
but provide a way for us to work together over it, using version control tools
like CVS, change control tools, discussion tools, and other Internet enabled
development and sharing tools.</p>

<p align="left">It it, because we believe in it, since trough all this years, we
have yet to discover more productive ways to make database oriented business
applications.</p>

<p align="left">And now, for one of our favorite quotes, from Crispin
Gardner-Webster:</p>

<p align="left"><i>&quot;Old saying that &quot;information is power&quot; is
less and less valid these days. More and more value is created trough
communication and sharing.&quot;</i></p>

<p align="left">It's for students, developers, consultants, commercial vendors,
every one is invited! If you want to use it in your commercial product, use it
for your customers, teach your students - it's for you. This is open project,
and there are absolutely no limitations. We are not competing with anyone, and
will gratefully receive help from everyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">To be explicit, if you work for Informix, 4Js, Querix, etc., we welcome
you interest, questions, criticism, comments, help. Feel free to use any work
done here, in any way that will benefit you, and hopefully, 4GL community.</p>

<p align="left"> The Aubit compiler is mostly
complete, but needs a little more work before it will be able to serve as
drop-in replacement for current
commercial solutions with simple recompile, particularly around reserved keywords.
See our release schedule document on <i>project</i> site. If you are prepared to manually resolve few issues here
and there (or just report them to us so we can fix them),&nbsp; you can compile
and run most existing 4gl code with it. You can also learn 4gl language with it, and if you have
the skills and will, help us develop it. Given the fast pace of development in
last year, we believe it is just a matter of time before Aubit 4gl will start
offering stability and performance needed in production environments.</p>

<h3 align="left"><font color="#00FF00"><a name="What can I do for it?">What can I do for it?</a></font></h3>

<p align="left">You can do a lot. You can participate in discussing the
development directions, share your needs and views, and if you have 4gl and C
skills, SQL/ODBC skills, or maybe Java, TCL/TK, GTK++ or similar skills for GUI interface development, you can join the development process.
We are also looking for 4GL programmers, that are willing to donate/develop 4GL
applications and / or libraries. You can also help with documentation and web
site. We are also looking for a nice logo!
Good starting point is to join out email discussion list.</p>
