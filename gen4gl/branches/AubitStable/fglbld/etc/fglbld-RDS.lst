#	@(#)fglbld.RDS	6.17 90/02/19
#	@(#)FGLBLD Version 6.12 (04/04/1990)
#	Definitive list of distributed files
#
#	These files are needed to use FGLBLD -- RDS Version.
#
#	-- The installed file column contains the name of the file to be
#	   installed.  The name is quoted relative to $FGLBLDDIR.
#
#	-- The type of file indicates what sort of file is to be installed.
#	-- The type "file" indicates an ordinary file
#	-- The type "directory" indicates that the file is the name of a
#	   directory under $FGLBLDDIR which must exist when the software
#	   is installed.  The installation program will create the directory
#	   if it does not already exist.  The directory entry must come before
#	   the first file entry which lives in the directory.
#	-- The type "deleted" means that this file used to exist in a previous
#	   release of the software and is no longer relevant.  The file will
#	   be removed from the installed system.
#	-- The type "link" means that the installed file is a link to a file
#	   already installed.  The name in the Link column is the name of the
#	   file (relative to $FGLBLDDIR) which the file is to be linked to.
#	   This file must already exist.  If the line is not a link entry, a
#	   dummy value (conventionally '-') must be present in the column.
#       -- The type "configure" means that the installed file has to be
#          configured using the mkscript shell script.  This fills in the
#          installed values of $FGLBLDDIR and the other configuration
#          parameters.  It also means that the script is put in the relevant
#          public bin directory which is, in general, not the same as
#          $FGLBLDDIR/bin.  The installed file name is where the source is
#	   found under $FGLBLDDIR; the link file is the name the file should
#	   have in the $FGLBLDBIN directory.
#
#	-- Permissions are the file permissions to be set on the file.
#	   The three subfields are owner, group, mode.
#	   The owner - is used to indicate the owner of the FGLBLD system.
#	   The group - is used to indicate the group of the FGLBLD system.
#	   Other owner/group values are treated as literal values.
#
#	-- Comment lines start with a hash (#)
#	-- Blank lines are ignored
