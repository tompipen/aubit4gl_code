In order to get informix style serial numbers (where you can insert a 0 etc)



Try installing the following postgres function :


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION next_seq_id() RETURNS trigger AS $$

    my ($col,$seq)=@_;
    my($newval);
    $newval=$_TD->{new}{$col};
    if ($newval==0) {
        $rv=spi_exec_query('SELECT nextval(\''.$seq.'\') as nextval', 1);
        $_TD->{new}{$col}= $rv->{rows}[0]->{nextval};
        return "MODIFY";  # modify row and execute INSERT/UPDATE command
    } else {
        if ($newval>0) {

                $rv=spi_exec_query('SELECT setval(\''.$seq.'\','.($newval).') ', 1);
        }
    }
    return;
$$ LANGUAGE plperl;


You'll need to ensure you've got plperl installed as part of your postgres installation - and you may need to install it 
into your database : 

$ psql somedb
somedb=# CREATE LANGUAGE plperl;


(This is probably *not* compiled up by default. - you may need to reconfigure postgres with '--with-perl' )


You'll need to enable this procedure on your tables with something like : 

	CREATE TRIGGER sometrigname BEFORE INSERT ON tabname FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE  next_seq_id('sercol','tabname_sercol_seq');


		where sercol is the name of the serial column in your table
		and tabname_sercol_seq is the name of the sequence generated for the serial column
		This is normally called 'tablename_columnname_seq'

You'll need to create one of these triggers for all the tables with a serial column...





Sample MDY function:

	CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION mdy(m integer, d integer, y integer) RETURNS date AS $$
	BEGIN
		RETURN to_date(m||' '||d||' '||y, 'MM DD YYYY');
	END;
	$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;


You'll need to ensure you've got plpgsql installed as part of your postgres installation - and you may need to install it 
into your database : 

$ psql somedb
somedb=# CREATE LANGUAGE plpgsql;
