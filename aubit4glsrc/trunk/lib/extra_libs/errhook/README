This is a sample error hook function

The function takes 4 parameters 
	Line 
	Module
	Error  # 
	ErrorMessage


Usage
-----

You need to set the environment variable ERRHOOK (or the older CALLERRHOOK)
to be the name of the library that holds a function called 'errlog'.

That function is called when a program dies because of an error
(it isn't called for a core dump, or an EXIT PROGRAM etc)

eg: 
	
    cd lib/extra_libs/errhook

IF AUBIT HAS BEEN COMPILED FROM SOURCE, THEN:
    make
    export ERRHOOK=errhook_sample			# or CALLERRHOOK

IF AUBIT HAS BEEN DOWNLOADED AS BINARY FILES, THEN:	
    4glc --as-dll sample.4gl -o YOUR_LIBRARY_NAME.so	# choose a convenient name for the *so file
    # AND MOVE THE SHARED OBJECT FILE TO A POSITION WHERE IT WILL BE FOUND USING LD_LIBRARY_PATH OR ldconfig
    export ERRHOOK=YOUR_LIBRARY_NAME

NOTE:  You dont need a leading 'lib', or the '.so'
