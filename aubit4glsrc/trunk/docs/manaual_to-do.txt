Michael John Kuzminski [mkuzminski@ldcglobal.com] :


Would it be possible to make a request for more character array functions
that would allow you to maniuplate those character arrays? For example, an
"instring" function which would locate the first occurence of a set of
characters? I have developed my own, but I know that this would be
beneficial as part of the language.

btw, here is my code:

FUNCTION instr(start_pos,searched,sought)
    DEFINE start_pos        INTEGER
    DEFINE pos_found        INTEGER
    DEFINE searched         CHAR(512)
    DEFINE sought           CHAR(128)
    DEFINE sought_len       INTEGER
    DEFINE len_start_pos    INTEGER
    DEFINE total_length     INTEGER
    #Description: Function to search for a character or string within
another string
    #Arguments  : start_pos - position in searched to being searching;
typically 1
    #           : searched - the string to be searched
    #           : sought - the string or character you are looking for
    #Returns    : the position where the sought string or character appears
    #           : returns a 0 (zero) if not found,
    #Author     : Michael Kuzminski
    #Date       : 10-4-01
    LET pos_found = 0
    LET sought_len = LENGTH(sought)
    LET len_start_pos = start_pos + LENGTH(sought)-1
    LET total_length = (LENGTH(searched) - LENGTH(sought)+1)

    #Error checking
    IF start_pos > LENGTH(searched) THEN
        ERROR "Function instr: Start position exceeds string length to be
searched!"
        SLEEP 5
    ELSE
        FOR start_pos = start_pos TO total_length
            IF searched[start_pos,len_start_pos] = sought THEN
                LET pos_found = start_pos
                EXIT FOR
            ELSE
                LET len_start_pos = len_start_pos + 1
            END IF
        END FOR

downshift not working

compiler stops after first error, why?

CONNECT can't take variables as parameters.
Theres a bug - it doesn't trim the username and password, so it logs you in
as 'mike         ' rather than 'mike'.


intervals partially implemented and their 'UNITS'.
There is still currently no maths allowed on datetime/intervals. (Ie no "00:03:00" + "00:02:00".)

Its worth bearing in mind that the error numbers and codes in a4gl and i4gl
will be different anyway...

#this works fine
                OPEN SESSION s_id1 TO DATABASE ptest as user "postgres" password "pg"
#this does not:
#				OPEN SESSION s_id1 TO DATABASE DSN_postgres as user "postgres" password "pg"
#this does not compile at all
#				OPEN SESSION s_id1 TO DATABASE _variable(DSN_postgres) as user "postgres" password "pg"


help files: No - it doesn't look for files anywhere but the current directory - this
will need fixing..

aubit programs need to look for .afr not .frm for forms to avoid colision with i4gl
when compiling in same directory

fcompile should produce afr files.

Is this fixed?: Another reason for a core dump on startup is if you haven't set SQLUID and
SQLPWD as environment variables, and you're accessing a database..

Put in builtin.c :


There as far as I know there is no standard D4gl function to do this.
We are using our own C code to set environment variable from 4gl and D4gl.

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
/* fgl_setenv()                                                               */
/*                                                                            */
/* This function allows to set or reset the value of environment variables.   */
/* It expects one parameter : a string like VARIABLE=value with maximum 1024  */
/* characters.  If the environment variable does not exists, it is created.   */
/*                                                                            */
/* Example : call fgl_setenv("DBPATH=/usr/app/appx")                          */
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

int fgl_setenv(noarg)
int noarg ;
  {
    char *putvar ;

  /*
   On some machines (e.g. SCO Unix) putenv(C) makes the argument string
   part of the environment, so if you change the string ,
   the environment changes.
   Therefore we must malloc a new string for each call of fgl_setenv.
  */
  putvar=(char *)malloc(1025);

  popquote(i_s,sizeof(i_s));
  clip(i_s);
  if (putenv(i_s))
    {
    fprintf(stderr,"\nFGL_SETENV(%s) : Failed.\n",i_s);
    _efemode();
    exit(1);
    }
  return(0);
  }

If you want to use this function you have to follow instructions for use of c functions.

I hope that this will help you.

Not that I know of, but that is far from saying that it doesn't exist.

About the only offer I can make is http://www.informix.com/answers

Looking at index in the CLI 2.5 manual, under INSERT, it mentions
SQLParamOptions().  The manual page for SQLParamOptions() mentions 'bulk
inserts'.

------------------------------------------------------


Note that message files are specified in full - no implied extension -
where as form files are not specified in full - the extension is
implied.  Now, you could sensibly ensure that the extension for a
message file is in fact implied for Aubit -- that would be an
improvement.

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use `-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the `-Wl,--rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'

I've now added IN and EXISTS as valid 4GL expressions.
This means you can now :


IF a in (1,2,3) THEN

IF a not in (1,2,3) THEN

IF a in (select tabid from systables) THEN

IF exists (select * from systables where tabid=1)  THEN
IF NOT exists (select * from systables where tabid=1)  THEN

should all now work..

[ For ones using SQL - at the minute - you can't use any variables in the
SQL.. I'll fix this soon.. ]

(Is MATCHES allowed in 4gl ?) MATCHES should already be in there...

IF exists (variable_name )  THEN - is NOT implemented

Ancient history remembered through the haze...

In the beginning was C-ISAM, and then the original Informix product,
which reached version 3.30 on Unix, and apparently 3.60 on DOS.  This
product did not use SQL.

Then Informix-SQL 1.10 was released, with no support for NULLs; this
was released in 1985 or early 1986, I believe.

Then Informix-SQL 2.00 and Informix-4GL 1.00 were released in mid-1986;
C-ISAM and ESQL/C had release numbers 3.00, I believe.  This was also
the point at which I started working with Informix products.  My first
task was to learn enough to be able to teach I4GL and ISQL 2.00, only
to find that the machine I was to use for the course had ISQL 1.10
on it (it was a Z8000 box, and the superuser was called zeus, not root).

Then Informix-SQL 2.10 and Informix-4GL 1.10 were released, and I
think this was when I4GL-RDS and I4GL-ID appeared.

Since Informix 3.30 was still relatively recent, the next versions
were called ISQL 2.10.03 and I4GL et al 1.10.03 on Unix to avoid the
ineveitable confusion if it was called Informix SQL 3.00; I believe
the versions were 2.10.06 and 1.10.06 on DOS.  Also, Informix-Turbo
1.10.03 was released, and it was pointed out as a future direction
that SE would be separated from the ISQL and I4GL tools -- until then,
the engine had always been distributed with ISQL, I4GL and I4GL-RDS
(but not ID since you needed RDS to make any use of ID).

To avoid confusion with Informix 3.30, the subsequent release was
version 4.00 of Informix-SE, Informix-OnLine, ISQL and I4GL (and C-ISAM
and ESQL/C) - there was never a 3.x version of the main products
other than (perhaps) C-ISAM and ESQL/C.  It was also at about this
point that the Tools and Servers groups were split apart.

Now, Plexus certainly had a hand in the Turbo to OnLine transition,
but I don't know what versions they used -- they may even have had a
3.1 Turbo product, as the original questioner mentioned it.  I don't
know, and I don't think the original questioner has chimed in again
to help clarify what they've got.  It is safe to assume that any Turbo
product is seriously out of date -- OnLine 5.00 was released effectively
in January 1991 (officially 30th December 1990 or thereabouts), and
there was a version 4.10 between 4.00 and 5.00.

As to the connection question -- the revised opinion is that you should
be able to use a network connection to an I-Net that matches the version
of Turbo.  I'm not wholly sure when I-Net arrived on the scene; I-Star
definitely arrived with 4.00 and OnLine, but I-Net probably pre-dates
that.  However, it is not going to be officially supported, and an
upgrade would be recommended.

===================================================================

I'm just going through this very topic in my text book (Discovering Computers, Shelly
Cashman Series, 2001 edition), and here's how the book classifies the programming
languages:

"1GL - Machine Language

2GL - Assembly Languages

3GL - High-level languages, are machine-independent, use English-like words; require the
program to tell the computer not only WHAT to accomplish, but also HOW, therefore often
called procedural languages; use a compiler or interpreter to translate the source code
into machine language

4GL - use English-like statements; are NON-PROCEDURAL languages. The programmer only
specifies WHAT the program accomplish without explaining HOW. Many 4GLs work in
combination with a database. Example: SQL

5GL, or Natural Languages - do not have to follow a specific set of rules and syntax, like
4GLs. Are often associated with expert systems and AI. Popular in the medical field, but
are not widely used in business applications."

By the way, the book is being very nice to Cobol, and it states that ..."Cobol is one of
the more widely used procedural programming languages for business applications. Although
Cobol programs are often lengthy, their English-like statements make them easy to read,
write, and maintain... The most popular personal computer Cobol program is Micro Focus
Personal Cobol, which supports both procedural and object-oriented programming..."



3GLs are third-generation languages, such as BASIC,
Cobol, or Fortran. They were more advanced than "first
generation" machine languages and second generation
assemblers. 4GLs, originally defined as languages that
could offer a ten-fold (or was it a hundred-fold?)
increase in productivity relative to 3GLs, still exist in
forms such as Progress 4GL, Informix 4GL, Forte 4GL,
Cognos' PowerHouse 4GL, and Information Builders' FOCUS
4GL. More than a decade ago, Japan's MITI launched a 5GL
language project with the goal of embedding AI into
programming, but the effort fizzled.

INFORMIX-4GL: development environment composed by Menus (GUI generator), 
Forms (4GL code generator), ID (debugger), QuickStep (state machine) and a 
set of interfaces with C, Cobol, Adam Fortran.

INFORMIX-OpenCase: software development environment based on ToolBus (a software bus), ToolKit (interface with INFORMIX-4GL) and Encapsulator.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

At that time, the product had a table-oriented, non-SQL C interface that
used the data dictionary, but otherwise it was like C-ISAM. This was also
in the non-SQL product, though I can't remember if it was in the SQL
product. Clearly, the SQL product needed a pre-compiler based product that
provided all of the SQL syntax and cursors to C programmers. Chris Maloney
and I felt that C was still too low level for most programmers of data
processing applications. We designed Informix-4GL as an elegant
combination of Betty Chang's Perform screen package, Roy's SQL engine,
and Bill's report writer, sewn together with a language that would
provide powerful leverage of the data dictionary. This idea worked very
well, and I am still very proud of that product. It allowed us to
succeed when larger companies like Oracle finally came to the UNIX
market in a serious way in the late 1980s.

http://www.informixhandbook.com/


Chris Maloney and Roger Sippl - co-designed Informix-4GL based on:

Betty Chang - Perform screen package
Roy Harrington - SQL engine (wrote a smaller UNIX clone, Cromix)
Bill Hedge - ACE report writer


Chris Maloney Roger Sippl Betty Chang Roy Harrington Bill Hedge


Maloney created the specification for the Informix flagship product Informix-4GL and led the development team for the Informix database data access system. Later he was responsible for development of Viewpoint, a Windows based tool set for "non-programmers" and directed a 100 person development group responsible for Informix's "shrink wrap" business products. At Pencel, Maloney is responsible for product development.

Of course you can - you've just got to get the GtkObject associated with the

	ID_TO_INT( field_name)

DEFINE obj integer

menuhandlers - not currently for text mode - when?

Formhandlers and menuhandlers are autonomous units - ie you can have multiple
forms open - multiple menus. This is easy to do in GTK and windows etc -
because they are based on message passing and callbacks. The TUI is not...

It may be possible to have them - but how would you switch between windows ?
Do we assume they have a mouse ?
Do we dump the current TUI - because that works with loops rather than
callbacks..

I don't even think you can use the ncurses form library with callbacks - so
do we rewrite that too ?


It all starts to get very very messy..

Formhandler
This section manipulates and exchanges data with a form. Each formhandler
section begins with the statement FORMHANDLER name and ends with the
statement END FORMHANDLER. A formhandler is active as long as its
form is open. Unlike functions, formhandlers cannot have input or return
parameters. For more information on formhandlers, see “The Handler
Routines” on page 141.

Menuhandler
This section contains Windows 4GL statements that accept input from menus
and programmable keys. Each menuhandler module begins with the
statement MENUHANDLER name and ends with the statement END
MENUHANDLER. A menuhandler is active as long as its menu is
displayed. Unlike functions, menuhandlers cannot have input or return
parameters. For more information on menuhandlers, see “The Handler
Routines” on page 141.

DDEhandler
This section processes all messages exchanged via a Dynamic Data
Exchange (DDE) between a client application and a server application. There
can only be one DDEhandler in an AD32 application. A DDEhandler routine
begins with the statement DDEHANDLER and ends with the statement END
DDEHANDLER. For more information on DDE, see the Dynamic Data
Exchange chapter starting on page 247.


curr_file_name CHAR(13) Current 4GL file name.
curr_line_no CONST Current 4GL line number; curr_line_no
is actually a CONST, but behaves like a
variable in that the value is equal to the
current line number.
err_file_name CHAR(13) 4GL file name where an error occurred.
err_line_no SMALLINT 4GL line number within the file where
an error occurred.


Use the user interface data types to access objects created or defined in the
UIBuilder.

FORM
A variable with the type FORM identifies a form, as defined in UIBuilder.
The predefined variable curr_form, used only within a formhandler, refers to
the form attached to that formhandler by an OPEN FORM statement.

STATUSBOX
Variables of type STATUSBOX identify a status box, which can be defined
in UIBuilder or Windows 4GL code.

1) 	Status
    ------

	The perl stuff is experimental and no where near fully functional - for
	example - I'm still working on getting function calls to work !

2)  Prerequisites
    -------------

	Install Perl (www.perl.org) , and then Swig (http://www.swig.org/)

	you need to compile swig up from source:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

3)  Make aubit 4gl Perl-generating compiler and libraries
    -----------------------------------------------------

	cd $AUBITDIR
	make perl

    this will create $AUBITDIR/bin/4glc_perl compiler, Perl libraries and
	compile up the swig interface and copy it to the right places.

4) Ussage:

	To compile 4gl program to Perl:

	4glc_perl hello.4gl

	This will generate hello.pl, to run

	$ perl hello.pl

    - or -

	$ chmod 777 hello.pl
	$ ./hello.pl

Yes - for now - but I'll be doing a compile_dl eventually which should be
retargetable for those with shared library capabilities (most modern Unix's

Ok; so if I'm reading this correctly, BLD thing is good to be used as is, to quickly get Perform like functionality, with very little coding.

GEN thing is supposed to be much more, but needs more work, will require more coding to get results, but it will be much more powerful.

If this is correct, I would like them both in Aubit, since they cover two related, but ultimately different tasks.

BLD would probably make a nice extension to adbaccess code we already have in CVS, approaching "isql" functionality.

GEN would probably be a standalone tool, when it's finished, possibly integrated into your IDE code.

How does that sound?

Ok, I converted fglbld.big to PS/PDF/text - html don't work for some reason

16:23:19 root@aptiva /usr/aubit/fglcodegen/BLDManual# groff -Thtml fglbld.big
groff: can't find `DESC' file
groff:fatal error: invalid device `html'

All is in fglbld.big, right? All formatting lost unfortunately. See attached.

If you can confirm this is all, I can reformat it in HTML manually.

Must say, looks impressive to me. I expect we will have no problem generating sufficient interest to get the work needed started.

I would say, this is exactly what I was looking for. Initially we should give it new CVS branch, like :

aubit4glsrc
aubit4gldoc
aubit4glwww
hy4gl
fgldocgen		- Sergio's tools
fgllib		- Starting with Power-4gl
..
fglgen/fglgen
fglgen/fglbld

But ultimately, I would like to see fglbld in adbaccess, or at least for this to be an option, and fglgen integrated in your IDE, or some other IDE, or at least for this to be an option.

BTW: I'm looking at NetBeans IDE (written in Java, but supports different languages) and "Source Navigator" (RedHat-ex. Cygnus). CodeCrusader is no longer OpenSource. I'm looking for IDE that is OpenSource, GPL, multiplatform, and have ability to be extended into supporting 4gl. Ideas?

I'm using GWD text processor, and I built in most of the functions of IDE in it using scripting inside it (ANSII C), but this is shareware, and not multiplatform (OK, I run it on Linux under Wine, but this is not what I want)

If mine is not OK, please do. Especially if you can do -Thtml

Will you be sending me code for import, or do you want to do it yourself?

Thanks again,
Andrej

Its missing because its very incomplete...

decompile should just use dump.c rather that dump_java.c...

fcompile and mcompile both compile source files to an XDR format file (hence
the .x).
For each - I've included a 'decompiler' which decode the XDR format file into
english (ish).

the dump_java.c was an attempt to decode the XDE format file into a java
class - I haven't  got past the first few lines yet..

======================================================================

Aubit compiler now by default compiles with dynamic SQL support.

This means that just by changing a value of A4GL_SQLTYPE environment variable,
you can decide at run-time which SQL libraries compiler and/or your programs will use.

At the moment, there are "noodbc" "iodbc" and "unixodbc" dynamic SQL libraries 
available; naturally, on Windows, you only have the choice of "noodbc" and "odbc32", 
but since Windows OS always have ODBC manager, this is down to "odbc32".

I see Mike already added new directory called "esqlc" - for native Informix support.

David, since you implemented PostgreSQL native support in your Hy4GL, is there 
any code there we can use, and would you possibly be interested in implementing 
this for Aubit compiler?

Since UI support is already dynamically loaded (?), I suspect Mike's next target
will be dynamic loading of language output modules in compiler (C, Perl, Java...)

Consequence of this, will be that I will reduce number of binary builds from 8 to 4:

unixodbc-gtk-nopdf iodbc-gtk-nopdf unixodbc-nogtk-nopdf iodbc-nogtk-nopdf
unixodbc-gtk-pdf unixodbc-nogtk-pdf iodbc-gtk-pdf iodbc-nogtk-pdf

to

gtk-nopdf nogtk-nopdf gtk-pdf nogtk-pdf

I can see no particular reason other then the size of the download, to separate 
GTK and noGTK builds, since if you don't have GTK libs installed, you can always 
use AUBITGUI=text. If this is correct, I can as well go down only to:

aubit-nopdf aubit-pdf

Then again, it is still not clear to me why do we have PDFlib linked in 4glc and 
all libraries. Mike, if this can also be loaded dynamically, we can go down to 
one binary distribution.

There is libpdf-dummy.c in tools/html, can we do the same thing as we did with 
noodbc.c ?

Configuration:
--------------

There is a new variable in "aubitenv":

############
#name of SQL library to use (defaults to nosql = libSQL_nosql.so)
#when compiler was build with dynamic SQL support
#Options: static nosql iodbc unixodbc
export A4GL_SQLTYPE=unixodbc


To compile compiler with dynamic SQL support, there are a few new variables in aubitbuild.mk

#defines how will SQL support be built into compiler: dynamic is default.
#if you enter "static", only SQL/ODBC library defined with "ODBC"
#parameter will be linked. Parameters "ODBC"
ODBC_LINK=dynamic

#If linking SQL support dynamically, you can have more then one SQL
#manager/driver installed on your system, and compiled Aubit to use them
#selecting it at run time with environment variable :
#A4GL_SQLTYPE=libSQL_<name>.so [name of library to use (defaults to nosql)]
#if you define more then one HAVE_xxxx variable here as "yes" you MUST use
#AUBITBUILDMKMULTI to define multiple libraries paths
HAVE_UNIXODBC=yes
HAVE_IODBC=yes

To accommodate the fact that now we need to know multiple library names and paths at the same build time, aubitbuild-muli.mk was changed.

For examples of all this configuration changes, please see *.example files in $AUBITDIR/etc

How does this impact you?

1) If you don't want to use dynamic SQL support loading, add ODBC_LINK=static to aubitbuild.mk, and all will (should!) be the same.

2) If you want to use it, add appropriate settings, "make cleanall" and then "make", and all should work now with dynamic loading.

Let us know if you have problems,

Thanks Sergio,I was hoping someone have some link to FAQ or something that explains proper version management on higher level. I doknow how to read manual, and execute commands, but I don't really have understanding of why, in which order, how to usetags once they are applied, what files they are applied to, etc.For instance, if I want to be able to pull a specific version of Aubit code from CVS, what do I do:a) to mark all files as belonging to specific version/buildb) to checkout this from CVS?

I've just changed some of the PDF handing.

It now used A4GL_PDFTYPE to determine which library to link with when using
4glpc - there was no need to actually use DL linking for the PDFs.
You need to 'make' in the lib/libpdf directory..

make libPDF_NOPDF.so

or

make libPDF_PDF.so

a 'make' on its own will try to compile both...



A4GL_PDFTYPE defaults to NOPDF, you need to set this to PDF if you want to
use PDF reports...


(If you want to make this the default - you could modify the line in
lib/resources.c - possibly using #ifdef ... etc.)

============================================================

TODO : how can I automatically create list of changes from CVS logs?

=============================================================
I've made a couple of changes today (and fixed a couple of new bugs)

1) Resources
You can now have resources stored in files
Each line must be
VARIABLE=VALUE
with NO SPACES around the '='
(Use a # as a comment)

EG.

MYVAR=1 #Set Myvar=1
DBDATE=dmy4/
.
.
.


These are added as user resources (can be overridden by environment variables
though).

Resource are looked for in
1) /etc/aubitrc,
2) $AUBITDIR/etc/aubitrc,
3) ./.aubitrc (notice the '.' at the beginning of this one)
4) $A4GL_INIFILE

If more than one of these exist - entries are overwitten in the order given
above..
(eg /etc/aubitrc says DBDATE=dmy2, ./.aubitrc says DBDATE=dmy4 , DBDATE will
be read as dmy4)



2)
I've also added a aubit-config.c to lib/ which gets compiled up with
resource.c to form the "aubit-config" program

$ aubit-config DBDATE
dmy4/

This should be the first thing made and can then be used for the makefiles
where required..


3) Made a couple of changes to SHARED handling - removed the old method
(which looked bad) and introduced the "::" syntax as per perl (as someone
here suggested a while ago)

So I've added a new library in lib/extra_libs/file for file handling as an
example.

Try the 'file.4gl' example in tools/test...
Snippet :

        CALL A4GL_file::fopen("tmyextfile","r") returning afile

        IF afile=0 THEN
                ERROR "Unable to open a file called 'textfile'"
                        WAIT FOR KEY
                EXIT PROGRAM
        END IF

        DISPLAY "afile=",afile

        LET status=0
        CALL A4GL_file::fsize(afile) returning fsize

        IF status!=0 THEN
                DISPLAY "ERROR : ",A4GL_file::ferror(afile);
        END IF

        DISPLAY "Size=",fsize
        WHILE TRUE
                CALL A4GL_file::fgets(afile) returning buff
                IF A4GL_file::feof(afile) THEN
                        EXIT WHILE
                END IF
                DISPLAY "Read '",buff clipped,"' from file"
        END WHILE

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*		Added an 'fshow' and 'fshow-gtk' utility which previews how a form will look

----------------------------------------------------------------

Mike,

1) can we prevent it from code dumping, and rise the error when DATABSE is found in prepare?

2) Any other statemnts affected, other then DATABASE?


>BTW - I don't get a core dump - I get
>
>Program stopped at 'prepdb.4gl', line number 5.
>Error status number -759.
>[unixODBC][OpenLink][ODBC][Informix Server]Cannot use database commands in an

At least CREATE DATABASE, ROLLFORWARD DATABASE, START DATABASE, CLOSE
DATABASE, DROP DATABASE are also affected by that error.

If you do CONNECT TO '@server' then you can issue database commands.

Don't forget that DATABASE x and DATABASE :var and so on can be prepared
in I4GL, and - further - often are used.  Especially with retargetable
programs that can connect to arbitrary databases.

This is a known deficiency of using Aubit4GL - the SQL is

passed to the backend, not processed by 4GL.

4GL is the bit that understands how to connect to an ODBC

database.



As the database command accepts a variable, a suitable

workaround would be



DEFINE m_database CHAR(20)

.

.

LET m_database="maindb"

DATABASE m_database







This is not a bug - its a feature of how a4gl works.



For example - you wouldn't expect an Informix database to

accept a

'Database dbname' where dbname was a mysql database now

would you ?

Sound good to me.

1) We should later remove checking for non-prefixed variables, maybe at 0.40 ?

2) I will modify aubitrc file to define everything with A4GL_ prefix.

I'll leave only "configure" in root; I'll move enverything in etc/config, and create a bootstrap script. Developers will use it. Users will not.

After I release 0.30 - I'm a little sick of delaying it more for whatever reasons. I need to make RPM and fow windows port - that's it.

==============================================================

It may be useful - but dont forget - we have 'constants' now which do the
bulk of the #define's work...

DEFINE gc_arr_max CONST 100
DEFINE my_Arr ARRAY[gc_arr_max] OF ...
.
.
FOR a=1 TO gc_arr_max
  LET my_Arr[a]=..
END FOR

etc.

The bulk of the '#INCLUDE' functionality is
1) To set up constants (#defines)
2) To set up names for structures

As we don't have named structures this is a non-issue
For the constants defined in the #included file- we can use GLOBALS files
instead :

fseek.4gl:

GLOBALS
DEFINE
     gc_seek_set CONST 0,
     gc_seek_cur CONST 1,
     gc_seek_end CONST 2
END GLOBALS


myfile.4gl:

GLOBALS "fseek.4gl"

MAIN
   CALL fseek(somefile,gc_seek_set)
END MAIN

About RPM package:
------------------

RPM installation includes automatic running of configure script, so only thing you need to do is:

	rpm -i aubit4gl-<version>-1.i586.rpm

You can of course use GUI RPM clients instead, but at this stage I don't recommend this, because if anything goes wrong,
you will not be able to see any messages, only that it failed. So please use command line rpm for now, so you can report
any potential problems.

There are still some problems with configure in binary tree, for example:

	checking for gcc... gcc
	checking whether we are using the GNU C compiler... no
	checking whether gcc accepts -g... no
	...

You can ignore this; it's not really relevant to binary builds at the moment, so go ahead and install it. Extensions
used by Aubit compiler (ODBC managers, GTK+ GUI libraries, PDF library, etc...), everything installed in standard paths,
that is relevant for binary distro should be detected automatically.

Since you cannot pass flags to RPM that would be passed to configure, things that require command line options (usually
because they are installed in non-standard locations) to "configure", like "--with-xxx=<path>" will of course NOT be
detected, and you will have to run "make CPARAM=--with-xxx=<path>" after RPM finishes to detect that things and create
new aubitrc configuration file - if you want. You can of course also manually edit aubitrc if you prefer.

Another way around this limitation of RPM is to create a file called "aubitconf" and place it somewhere in the path.
Make sure it will be in the $PATH when you run "rpm -i". In it, put only one line, for example:

./configure --with-something=/path/to/something --with-anotherthing=/another/path ...etc...


what will happen, is that if configure finds "aubitconf" in path, it will run it, instead of "normal" configure you
initially invoked:

For instance, on my system this will look like this:

====================================================================
[root@aptiva aubit4gl]# configure
checking for aubitconf... /bin/custom/aubitconf
Note: 'aubitconf' script found; running 'configure' via 'aubitconf'...

WARNING: if you provided command line options to 'configure', they will
be ignored, and ones provided in 'aubitconf' used instead. Use
--disable-aubitconf to disable this behavior.

Running ./configure with options:
--with-www-name=www.falout.com --with-dot=/mnt/disk2/data2/install_sources/doxygen/gv1.7c/bin --with-iksemel=/mnt/disk2/
usr/local --with-pdf=/mnt/disk2/usr/local --with-iodbc=/mnt/disk2/opt/iODBC_3beta/iODBC --with-informix --with-pgsql
checking for aubitconf... /bin/custom/aubitconf
Configuring binary distribution
checking build system type... i586-pc-linux-gnu
...etc...
====================================================================

Same thing will happen no matter how "configure" is invoked, for both source code and binary distributions. This is also
a very practical solution for not having to type all switches you need over and over again. Just create aubitconf for
your system, put it in, say, /usr/bin, and you will always get configure using them.

I was trying to be very conservative with "requires", so this RPM should work on all GLIBC 2.2/x systems. OTOH, I
probably missed some dependencies, since I had to disable automatic detection built in RPM, since it would declare ALL
Aubit compiler options as mandatory.

This RPM will require fairly recent version of RPM to work. I'm not sure which version is needed exactly, but you will
get a message to this effect if you need to upgrade RPM. Please let me know which version of RPM where you on, if this
happens.

There is now :

All right.
Its a quick way of being able to call a simple C function.
A simple C function is one that accepts a series of 'int' sized arguments
(pointers are normally int sized - but doubles arn't), and returns a single
'int' sized argument.

For example :
	strcmp(a,b) is fine
	pow(x,y) is not (as x and y are both double)

To import strcmp this into 4gl you could :

FUNCTION strcmp(a,b)
DEFINE a,b CHAR(256)
DEFINE r INTEGER
code
r=strcmp(a,b);
endcode
RETURN r
END FUNCTION

But if you've got a few of these - its a little long winded - so the IMPORT
FUNCTION command does it for you (it will generate this function
automatically)

You need to specify the number of arguments so :

IMPORT FUNCTION strcmp(2)

----------------------------------------

I wrote this 4gltags program this morning so it's not fully tested yet,
but it seems to work fine.  It's written using flex (fast lex).  If you
don't have flex you can download the source from ftp.gnu.org/gnu/flex

This is analagous to ctags, but for 4gl source.  Below is a shell archive
containing the source and the makefile.  Move to a file and execute
sh 4gltags.shar

Let me know if there are issues.

Well, 4gl is weak in so many areas (as a language) that there are
occasions where you can't avoid using C-hooks.  gcj has a CNI, so
theoretically one could add "java hooks" via the C-hook mechanism
without adding the heft of a vm in your binary.  Embedding an
interpreted language like Perl or Python would be the "serious
mistake" IMO.

I've just updated the CVS with some new functionality
Aubit4gl will now help you with multilingual code !


There is an environment variable 'DUMPSTRINGS' which can be set, this will
generate a file called 'strings.lang' with all the strings from your 4gl
module.

$ export DUMPSTRINGS=
$ 4glpc m1.4gl -o m1

DUMPSTRINGS can also be set to 'ident' - more later.

The strings.lang file looks like this :

Hello:=
World:=

you can then rename this file (so it isn't overwritten) and then edit it eg.

$ cp strings.lang french.lang
(And then edit it to be:
Hello:=Bonjour
World:=Monde
)

When compiling the 4GL you can then use a second environment variable
'TRANSLATEFILE' to specify the new language
eg.

$ export TRANSLATEFILE=french.lang
$ 4glpc m1.4gl -o m1.french

This will replace any strings found in TRANSLATEFILE with the translated ones
associated with it.


If you want to select the language at runtime, you can do that too.

By setting DUMPSTRINGS=ident
you will generate a file like :

Hello:>0
World:>1

This allows you to assign a number to a string (notice :> rather than := ) .
You can then create your language files using these numbers - just like for
help files :

eg "french.msg" may contain

.0
Bonjour
.1
Monde

$ mkmess french
(This will create french.hlp)


All you need to do then is specify which language you want to use in your
program with :

OPTIONS LANGUAGE FILE "french.hlp"

If you want to be able to control which one - just use a variable instead of
'french.hlp'

Eg.
define lv_var char(20)
# Pick up our language from the environment
#
let lv_var=fgl_getenv("LANGUAGE")

if lv_var = " " or lv_var IS NULL then # default to english
        LET lv_var="english"
end if

let lv_var=lv_var clipped,".hlp"

options language file lv_var


There is an example in tools/test called lang.4gl, with associated .msg files
for english, french, german,spanish and italian as well as

Theres also a makefile to compile it all up and the source.lang file.

Just
$ make -f Makefile.lang

and you should be ok (make sure mkmess is in the bin directory - I had to
copy it manually for some reason).

GTK themes apply colours or images to applications that use GTK library.
The changes aare not made to windows borders or buttons (thosa are handeled
by a windows manager)

Themas source: gtk.themes.org

Installation:

When running GNOME:

Start-> Settings-> Gnome Controll Centr -> Desktop Theme selector.
Click on "Install new theme" and select your theme.

Not running GNOME:

Extract the downloaded theme tarball to some location, for eample
~/.gnome/themes (or /usr/share/themes for system wide)

make a file in your home directory called .gtkrc and add the following line
to it:

include~/.gnome/themes/our-theme-name-gtk/gtk/gtkrc

Just added libUI_CONSOLE.

This is a stdin/stdout UI which features :
DISPLAY ERROR MESSAGE
MENU & PROMPT
(Trying to use any other screen UI (eg input/construct) will core dump)

Everything is read from the standard input and written to the standard output.
There are no control characters sent, no screen formatting.
Eg

basic.4gl:

main
define a char(40)

prompt "Enter your name :" for a
display "Hello ",a clipped

end main
--
$ 4glpc basic.4gl -o basic
$ AUBITGUI=CONSOLE
$ export AUBITGUI
$ ./basic
Enter your name :Mike
Hello Mike
$ echo "Mike" | ./basic
Enter your name :Hello Mike
$

menus look like this:


----cut----


Menu name

1. First Option
2. Secong option
3. Exit program



----cut----



This should effectively replace the old NOCURSES environment settings which
will be removed (at some point)...

No form related (fcompile, fshow, fdecompile) or menus (mcomile, mdecompile)
programs are compiled / installed in this environment, since they are unable
to do anything usefull without RPClib.

Nothing as elaborate - But we have a skeleton for something less
sophisticated :


define new type a1 as record
        tabid integer,
        tabname char(18),
        nrows integer,
        rowsize integer
end record


define a as a1


When I just tried it - it didn't work - so I'll need to check why...
As for the comparisons etc. - these are a lot more difficult and I can't
really see the point for complex types.

Anyway - if you head down that route then you'll have OO4GL by default...

You could have something along the lines of :

define new type a1 as record
	        tabid integer,
	        tabname char(18),
	        nrows integer,
	        rowsize integer
	end record

	function aaa ()
	..
	end function
end type



etc if you want to move to a more OO system..

define a as a1


Anything along these lines will probably have to wait quite a while though....

(One thing I would like to introduce though is the ability to add datatypes
at some point. I'd love to add the GMP datatypes/functions in (see
http://www.gnu.org/directory/gnump.html ).


=======================================================================

I haven't done the server yet - so its a little difficult. - you'll need to
create you're own server (or find a public one )

A4GL will pass in the parameters as an array...
At least one public server I've tried, uses PHP as the server - which in some
versions has a bug - best probably to roll your own...


Your client sourcecode would then look like this :

main
define x char(20)
#                           URL                                         METHOD
        call external "localhost/cgi-bin/sample-cgi.cgi":sample.addition[1]
(1,2)  returning x
        display "x=",x
end main


The [1] is ignored for XMLRPC..

===================================================================


Usage: nm [OPTION]... [FILE]...
List symbols from FILEs (a.out by default).


  Your VC install should include a tool called "depends.exe"
(usually installed under Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\Tools).
Loading your app app/dll within depends should show you what
import dependencies your app has on cygwin1.dll.

  The command line tool dumpbin will give you similar info;
where depends attempts to resolve the imports an associate
them with a particular DLL, though, dumpbin will just give
you the raw IAT dump.

Hello *,

I just posted diagram of proposed architecture for Aubit compiler header files includes consolidation, at:

http://aubit4gl.sourceforge.net/aubit4gldoc/architecture/Aubit4gl_includes.htm

also accessible from updated documentation menu page, that no includes 4GLworks manual:

http://aubit4gl.sourceforge.net/aubit4gldoc/index.html

BTW, I'm still hoping for some comments on Aubit compiler architecture diagram, now in version 0.20:

http://aubit4gl.sourceforge.net/aubit4gldoc/architecture/Aubit4gl_arch.htm

Header files includes diagram is simplified, and instead of showing all possible combinations, shows only target level,  with no separate items in target class (one level for all compilers, one for aubitlib, one level for all loadable modules)

Currently, we have 80 header files.

According to proposal, this would go down to 41 (40).

Following assumptions where made:

* One compile target - one header file (libubit4gl is a target, it gets one private (_int) header file , 4glc is a target, libUI_ is a target, and so on...

* Loadable modules targets get there private header for specific implementation (for UI this is TUI, GTK, CONSOLE) and one for each class (in this case UI)

* All declarations/definitions that stay in source code files (.c) are static and static only.

* External headers (ANSI, POSIX, GTK, ODBC...) are included from highest level header file that still needs them, not from .c code directly.

* All declarations/definitions that are internal to target class (library,executable) go in private header file (targetname_int.h)

* There is (should not) be a need for libaubit and modules libraries (libUI_, libSQL_, ...) to access functions/variables in any executables.

* Modules libraries access to aubitlib and vice versa would go via API only. There should be no access to variables directly, and function call interface should be used in all cases, and defined as part of API. This includes variables like status, sqlca... This way we will be sure we have "well defined API's", and that nothing is going in or out bypassing API.

* Only aubitlib and API headers need to be globally visible.

List of all header files to be created:

Can you please put something together for the manual - and consider the people
that have no idea what this is?

I myself am not clear about what exactly "modularized packer" is, and if it's
in any way associated with data types loading, of how exactly is this working...

Very cool.

OK, so you DO need RPCGEN to compile this...
Idea is fantastic, but Sun RPC is killing me...

Mike:

No - thats the point - you need the header file (.h) generated by rpcgen and
thats it.
If you remember we agreed that this would be used for the internal
representation. So this .h file (which we could edit a little) would be added
to CVS and you would no longer need RPC at all (just use the CVS version of
the header file). I may extend the Xgen compiler to output the required .h
file as well - but this gets pretty complicated so don't hold you're
breath....

Can we use external XML parser library like Expat instead?

Mike:

You could try - but you need something to convert this into the internal
format (which may be difficult to do).

--------------------------------------------------

There can be more - the A4GL_FORMTYPE & A4GL_PACKER variables are used to
select which format is used.
The normal mode is the standard .frm, but this uses XDR for storing the data
(which is portable), this isn't easily readable from some other languages,
and is also hard to get hold of the libraries for on Win32.
For that reason - we plonked all the output routines into shared libraries so
you can pick and choose.

The A4GL_PACKER can be one of :

	PACKED *
	XML *
	PERL *
	XDR

This determines the library used to generate the output data.

The A4GL_FORMTYPE determines which of the master data output routines will be
used, this is either XDR or GENERIC.
Using XDR will just call the old routines, GENERIC will pick up the
PACKED,XML,PERL or XDR as set by the A4GL_PACKER.

To this extent - A4GL_FORMTYPE=XDR should probably be depreciated...
(This is from memory so I hope its right!)


I'll take a look at the escaping in XML - at the moment its just a set of C
code in libpacker/xml/pack_xml.c

------------------------

Hi,
Just to let you know I've just committed the new packer library.

Whats that then...

Well, basically forms and the new style menus (as well as anything else we
come up with) are stored in files in a format called XDR, which is a platform
independant format used by SUN RPC.
It was chosen because you can define the layout of the data (in a '.x' file)
and it will generate all the structures in a header file and the routines
required to read and write those structures automatically.

Anyway - to cut a long story shorter, this isn't ideal because :

1) The XDR format is not available on all platforms
2) The rpcgen program which processes the files we use isn't available on all
platforms
3) As we move to new languages (eg Java , Perl) we can't use the rpcgen'erated
code because thats pure 'C'.
4) Its not very readable

So we now have different 'packers', these are routines that take C structures
and turn them into files and vice versa. You can select which packer to use
by setting the environment variable "A4GL_PACKER"

I've implemented 4 so far:

1) PACKED
 This is very similar to XDR in that data is written in a hopefully portable
way (optionally non-portable if the required functions aren't available).
This will probably give the smalled output files

2) XDR
 This is the same as doing it the old way

3) XML (yes - that is XML)
 This stores and reads the data in an XML file. The reading is very limited
and can basically only read the XML files that it generates - IT IS NOT A
FULL BLOWN XML PARSER. It uses some odd constructs and isn't ideal - but
you'll get the idea when you see the output

4) PERL
This generates a data structure which can be used inside a perl program - its
pretty complicated stuff though using hashes for the data representation.
What you do with it after you've generated it is up to you, because this is
an output only library (ie it can't read back what its written).



It'll probably take a day or two to iron out any problems, so bear with me...

============================================================================

OK - I'm releasing this as beta code.
What's been done is to add a mechanism whereby datatypes can be added to the
4GL language.

This is done using shared libraries..

I've uploaded an example testmpz.4gl into the tools/test directory.

In order to use it -

$ cd lib/libexdata
$ make
(This will make the .so for the mpz datatype - assuming you have the gnu mp
[gmp] package installed)

The mpz datatype is a arbitrary precision integer datatype that can handle
very very large numbers...


This is the testmpz.4gl file :


import datatype mpz # Tell everything we need the mpz datatype
main
define a mpz
define b integer

call load_datatype("mpz") #actually load the datatype

let a=100 # simple assignment

for b=1 to 10
        call a:nextprime() returning a # This is a 'class' function which
						# returns a value
        display a
end for


display "Setting fib numbers"

for b=1 to 10
        call a:setfib(b)  # This has been defined as an 'inplace' function
				# ie change the variable itself
        display a
end for


end main


Enjoy!

===========================================================================


I actually put support for this in Hydra a number of versions ago, so
that the multiple page forms are correctly handled (although the
form compiler doesn't necessarily think so).

To select a given form page you can use:

DISPLAY PAGE pageno (where pageno is  number of pages-1)
[sorry it should be 1 to maxpageno for consistency, but its a minor
feature anyway].

Unfortunately, this isn't supported in any of our graphical clients.

Not alot..
You can convert it to perl script (which 99% works - with only a couple
of quirks!)

Or convert it to 4gl... (which also works)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Firstly - you need to copy  the perl runner scripts (the .pm's) from
perl_runner to the perl library directory (I used
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl - but yours maybe different)

Then - you need to make aace_perl :

make aace_perl

I think I added this back into the Makefile.in, so you should only need to
'configure' and then be able to 'make'.


Once you've got that - you can start

aace_perl myreport.aace

(a .aace is identical to a .ace)



When you want to run your report :

$ chmod 777 myreport.run.pl
$ myreport.run.pl


(You'll also have a myreport.aarc.pl - but that can be discarded).


Points to note :

The report runs via DBI - you'll need that set up in order to run any reports.

The connection is made using

	$dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:$dbtype:".$report->{"report"}{"dbname"});

Which may not suffice for some DBI database interfaces, the $dbtype is taken
from the AACE_DB environment variable and default to 'Informix' if not set.


The report compiles using the normal A4GL libraries (ie not DBI) so you'll
need those set up to compile the reports.

The report.pm is pretty much ok (there are a few bugs) - in particular there
is **NO** 'format every row end' section - you must use a proper format
section (PAGE HEADER, ON EVERY ROW etc).


Finally -

Just to complete the extra ace stuff - there is also aace_4gl

This converts an ACE report to 4GL doing all the necessary conversions
en-route.
Eg:


	DATABASE stores END
	OUTPUT
	        REPORT TO "myfile.out"
	END

	SELECT

	    tabname,
	    tabid
	FROM systables END

	FORMAT
	ON EVERY ROW
		PRINT tabname," ",tabid
	END


Becomes :

	MAIN
	   CALL run_report_systables()
	END MAIN

	FUNCTION run_report_systables()
	# Variables
	DEFINE lv_data RECORD
	   x_tabname CHAR (18),
	   x_tabid INTEGER
	END RECORD
# end of initialisation

	DECLARE c_r_systables CURSOR FOR
	   SELECT tabname,tabid FROM systables

	START REPORT rep_systables

	FOREACH c_r_systables INTO lv_data.*

 	 OUTPUT TO REPORT rep_systables (lv_data.*)
	END FOREACH

	FINISH REPORT rep_systables

	END FUNCTION

	REPORT rep_systables(lv_data)
	DEFINE lv_data RECORD
	   x_tabname CHAR (18),
	   x_tabid INTEGER
	END RECORD
	OUTPUT
	  TOP MARGIN 3
	  BOTTOM MARGIN 3
	  LEFT MARGIN 5
	  RIGHT MARGIN 132
	  TOP OF PAGE ""
	 REPORT TO "myfile.out"


	FORMAT

	ON EVERY ROW
	   PRINT lv_data.x_tabname , " " , lv_data.x_tabid

	END REPORT





(I just fixed the REPORT TO myfile.out !)


To use it - compile your ace report :

	$ aace somereport.aace
then run the processor on the resultant .aarc file

	$ aace_4gl somereport.aarc

This will dump to stdout - so :
	$ aace_4gl somereport.aarc > somereport.4gl


This will ALWAYS shove the MAIN..END MAIN block in so it can be compiled into
a standalone program.

You'll obviously need to remove that in order to put it into a larger
program...

======================================================================



If your putting module level variables before the globals:

The current stratergy (which needs fixing for other reasons) uses an indicator
in the variable static to mark the end of the globals/start of the module
level and another for the end of the module level/start of the local level.

This will almost certainly screw up if you don't have them in that order....


========================================================================

Hi all

I have committed some major changes to API_sql.c, API_odbc.c and related
files, to effect the following:

- conversion of SQL syntax from one dialect to another is now handled
  in API_sql.c  (the interfaces in libsql no longer have to do this )

- conversion is only done if you set A4GL_SQLCONVERT=YES and only if
  the dialect used by the program differs from that used by the DBMS
  interface.

- by default the system assumes the 4GL application is using Informix SQL
  syntax, but this can be changed by setting, for example,
  A4GL_SQLDIALECT=ORACLE.

- a new function A4GLSQL_set_dialect( ... ) has been added, to allow for
  a new 4GL directive to change the default SQL dialect at runtime
  ( syntax still to be implememented - Mike ?)
  eg.
      SET SQL DIALECT TO ORACLE

- Sergio, conversion can be automated for the native Postgres interface
  if you just include the following function :

  char *
  A4GLSQL_dbms_dialect( void )
  {
     return "POSTGRESQL";
  }

Note - I had to fiddle calldll.c (changed nullfuunc from static) so that
       I could prevent Aubit from dropping dead if the interface doesn't
       have the new optional _dbms_xxx functions.

I will continue to expand sqlconvert.c over the next few weeks, and I
will also look at some kind of user editable conversion config file.


NB : MULTIPLE SIMULTANEOUS INTERFACES/CONNECTIONS

I had to change API_sql.c to keep a list of open sessions so that I could
keep track of what SQL conversions were required. If you look at the code,
particularly the use of the linked list of sessions - is it possible to
load more than one interface and include libptr along with the session
info and get the system to switch dll's on the fly each time you change
session ?

=========================================================================



Just to clarify about Aubit extensions in general;

Aubit 4gl compiler is a programming language translator, meaning, it takes the 4GL source code, and spits out another programming language, currently C or Perl.

Therefore, when using C output (default), extensions normally used by C compiler can be applied, and passed to 4glpc compiler script:

Typically, in C, that would be:
	4glpc -c module1.4gl -o module1.o
	4glpc -c module2.4gl -o module2.o
	4glpc -o program1 module1.o module2.o

...and this will work just fine. Now, there is an issue of distinguishing between Aubit compiled programs and objects, and there are some existing conventions that people coming with experience of other 4gl compilers are aware of, and familiar with. For instance, users if I-4gl, C-compiled compiler, are used to something like:

	4glpc -c module1.4gl -o module1.o
	4glpc -c module2.4gl -o module2.o
	4glpc -o program1.4ge module1.o module2.o

(i-4gl c compiled actually outputs .ec, which is compiled by ESQL/C compiler to C, and then with native compiler to .o)

...and this will work just fine. Now, there is an issue of multi-4gl compiler environments, and multi-4gl compiler make files and make rules, like in Aubit's own Amake: not only you want to know which objects are compiled with particular compiler, you _HAVE_ to know, because make rules are _EXTENSIONS_ based. Therefore, to make this environment work, and tools like Amake work, we have to "invent" unique extensions for every compilers, and every file type, even if we don't really need them to compile and rune one program (Good example of this is a executable name, that will compile and run just fine without ANY extension).

Inside Amake, for example, Aubit extensions are defined as:

A4GL_PRG_EXT=.4ae
A4GL_OBJ_EXT=.ao
A4GL_FRM_EXT=.afr.xml
A4GL_HLP_EXT=.hlp
A4GL_LIB_EXT=.aox
A4GL_MNU_EXT=.mnu.xml

...in make include file called a4gl.mk. Same file for other compilers are called i4gl.mk, q4gl.mk and d4gl.mk, and contain equivalents for appropriate 4gl compiler.

NOTE: Aubit currently can have different extensions for forms and menus, that are dependent on the output packer used, but that's a different issue)

Same is defined in Aubit compiler and libraries, in file resource.c, as extensions used for compiling (now that 4glc can be used directly to compile objects and programs, instead of invoking it via 4glpc script) and at run-time, for opening form, help, and menu files.

Therefore, while not necessary, it is highly recommended to follow this naming scheme, in which case above commands will become:

	4glpc -c module1.4gl -o module1.ao
	4glpc -c module2.4gl -o module2.ao
	4glpc -o program1.4ae module1.ao module2.ao

While this extensions are not enforced, and can even be overridden form aubitrc, it is recommended way to do this.

Of course, 'elif' is used by the Bourne Shell and derivatives; Perl uses
'elsif' because Larry Wall chose not to use keywords which are another word
spelled backward -- a jibe at the Algol-like use of 'fi' and 'esac' in
Bourne Shell.  Of course, Bourne Shell is not self-consistent; for ... do
... done should use 'od' instead of 'done', but there was already a command
'od' - octal dump - when it was introduced, so the keyword was pre-empted
by the command.  I'd probably nominate ELSIF as 'the' choice for I4GL/A4GL,
but I'm not going to be fussed if you go with ELIF for some other reason.




==========================================================================




Just for the record, I'm currently working on a .EC lex library.
This is basically the same as the .C library for all but the SQL stuff.

I've kept the basic functionality of the current Aubit SQL stuff in
their too, so I imagine we'll eventually loose the liblex/lex_c
directory and generate the LEX_C and LEX_EC directly from the lex_esqlc
directory stuff..

The ESQL/C stuff is currently targeted at informix ESQL/C - but this
should be relatively straight forward to convert to others (possibly
that UESQL/C (c++) library I've seen on slashdot..)

The one thing to bear in mind is that this is completely different to
the esql/c connection library sergio is writing (that is a LIB_SQL
library).

If you use the .EC Lex - you'll get a .ec file you can compile up using
your esql equivalent. You'll then ONLY be able to connect to that
database. You'll completly ignore the libSQL stuff and therefore NOT be
able to retarget the database connectivity....


===========================================================================


I have done some further work on the SQL dialect conversion functionality.

CONFIG FILE BASED CONVERSIONS

convert_sql() now uses configuration files.  These are by default
located in /opt/aubit4gl/etc/convertsql/, but that can be changed
with A4GL_SQLCNVPATH.

The conversion files are named <source-<target>.cnv, eg.
INFORMIX-POSTGRES.cnv, and they contain a list of directives
indicating what conversions/translations are required.

Details are in /opt/aubit4gl/etc/convertsql/README.txt
I will put this into the aubit4gl manual (html) in the next few days.


COMMAND LINE CONVERSION TOOL
In tools/convertsql is a simple utility that can be used to convert SQL
script files.  I included this as many people use .sql scripts outsided of
their 4GL programs.
eg:
    convertsql  INFORMIX  POSTGRES < myscript.sql > myscript.pg

Andrej - my Makefile here needs work; please have a look.

NOTE

This stuff is far from complete - I still have more work to do on the
conversion routines, eg. oracle style outer joins with (+).

I also need assistance on building up the config/rule files, especially
for SAPDB and Oracle.

Actually, much remains to be done on this interface.

Some conversions can be done by simple search and replace rules,
but most require coding, either because the transformations are
considerable (beyond easy regex'ing), or because they apply in
specific contexts.

The idea is to gradually build up the 'coded' conversions while allowing
for search/replace rules to handle anything not yet covered.
I am trying to work on a simple way to include some context-sensitivity
into the REPLACE command.
eg. you might want "SELECT UNIQUE ..." to become "SELECT DISTINCT ...",
but you don't want "CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ..." changing to "CREATE DISTINCT
INDEX ..."
similarly, other conversions are only applicable when the search string
appears in an expression or as a column name (like 'user' or 'today').



===========================================================================


I've also included code for auto initializing module and function local
variables (but you need to set A4GL_AUTONULL=YES to get this)...

or is it just Y ?

===========================================================================


2) I've added an ansi warning mode.

You can enable it by setting either :

	A4GL_ANSI_WARN=Yes
or
	A4GL_ANSI_ERROR=Yes

At the minute this only picks up two errors - but we can expand it as we go
along.


For ANSI_WARN - it will display a warning if it sees anything amiss...
For ANSI_ERROR - it will bomb the compile (.err file etc)

If neither of these is set - then nothing happens at all and the compiler is
happy....

============================================================================

Added a FILESCHEMA sql library.
This is to be used **JUST** for compiling programs where either the database
doesn't exist yet - or you can't get immediate access to it..
This takes the 'database' as a filename (with a .schema extension) and uses
that to collect the data.

The format of the file is :

[table1]
column datatype size
column datatype size
column datatype size
[table2]
column datatype size
column datatype size
column datatype size

etc...

There is a mkerror script which greps these out and makes the error

Yes - ish...

They are in lib/libaubit4gl/compat.c - I've only implemented the ones I've
come across so far, so its not complete..

The preferred mechanism is to use code/endcode instead for most things:

function do_somethin_in_4gl(lv_int,lv_char)
define lv_int integer
define lv_char char(80)
code
printf("int=%d char=%s\n",lv_int,lv_char);
endcode
end function


This takes a lot of the work out of doing it now - but doesn't help to much
when porting an older app..

I've added the following function to Aubit4gl TUI mode (there is a blank
entry in GTK mode)

call aclfgl_dump_screen(filename)

This will dump the current screen to the file converting the drawing
characters for windows to +/|/- where required.

This will allow for us to compare with the output from informix...


I've tested the following routine with Informix c4gl and it seems to
work the same way :


#include <stdio.h>
#include <ncurses.h>
#include "fglsys.h"

FILE *f;

int scr_width = 80;
int scr_height = 24;

aclfgl_dump_screen (int n)

  int mode = 1;
  char buffer[255];
  char *buff;

//w=find_pointer ("screen", WINCODE);
  w = curscr;

  if (n == 1)
    {
      popquote (buffer, 255);
    }

  if (n == 2)
    {
      popint (&mode);
      popquote (buffer, 255);
    }

  ptr = buffer;
  trim (ptr);
  strcat (buffer, ".infx");

  if (mode == 3)
    {
      scr_dump (ptr);
      return 0;
    }

  sh = 24;
  sw = 80;

  f = fopen (ptr, "w");
  if (f == 0)
    return 0;

  for (y = 0; y < sh; y++)
    {
      for (x = 0; x < sw; x++)
        {
          attr = mvwinch (w, y, x);
          if (mode == 0)
            {
              buff = (char *) &attr;
              /* @todo - Fix for different ENDISMS */
              fprintf (f, "%c%c", buff[2], attr & 255);
            }

          if (mode == 1)
            {
              fprintf (f, "%c", attr & 255);
            }

Andrej - can you find a home for this ?

Note - the informix c4gl routine above appends .infx to the filename so
you can run the same program, compiled under the two compilers and
compare the outputs with no source code changes...

=======================================================================

I've modified the 'getting screen size' routines to use COLUMNS and
LINES environment variables if they are set (It will use A4GL_COLUMNS
and A4GL_LINES in preference if they are defined).

This should make it work with a normal (not xterm) terminal session.

As I don't have this particular problem on any of my systems (Andrej has
reported it) - I can't test if this provides a solution - so give it a
go...


=========================================================================


How about -

4glpc -N "myprefix" myfile.4gl
4glpc --namespace "myprefix" myfile.4gl

It defaults to "aclfgl_" (ie as it is at the minute), specifying "" will cause
it to work like the old informix way..

All function/report definitions and calls are prefixed with that namespace...


I put this in on thursday...

===========================================================================

As for the options - there are two mechanisms for loading forms into 4GL
1) Using XDR (the original mechanism)
2) Using libpacker (new generic handling)
To choose one - set
	A4GL_FORMTYPE=XDR
or
	A4GL_FORMTYPE=GENERIC

(Look for libFORM_xxx.so - there is also a NULL version for machines with no
curses library - largely superceeded by libUI_console.so

For quite a few of Aubits environment variables - there is little checking on
the value itself - but rather on the existance of the respective .so file)


XDR BTW - is a routine thats used by the standard Unix RPC to encode data for
going across the network - I nicked the outline for encoding the data so it
will write it to a file instead...

If you are using libpacker (the generic one) you can then choose which packer
you want to use :
A4GL_PACKER=...

There are currently 4 possible values (look for libPACKER_xxx.so)

PACKED	- a standard packed format - should be quite small output
PERL 		- a special format that generates a complex perl variable
XDR 		- another way to generate XDR format files
XML 		- The XML version


There is also  "libPACKER_MEMPACKED.so" - this is used internally and
shouldn't be selected...


The standard should be XDR or PACKED.



The XML version (Which is slightly crippled with its strings at the moment -
they are written in hex rather than as strings) is a sort of half-way house
XML.

The files generated by fcompile can be read by any standard XML tool, but the
code to import the data within Aubit4GL expects it to be in exactly the
original format generated - no extra lines, no less lines etc. I didn't want
to get into having to add a whole XML parser to aubit4GL...

=============================================================================

Two new environment variables

A4GL_SIMPLE_GRAPHICS
if set to Y then +,|,- will be used to draw graphics characters instead of
proper borders (if available)

A4GL_EXTENDED_GRAPHICS
If set to Y allows forms to contain the additional graphics characters
<,>,^,v, and + to be used for tee's and an  intersection...

So the following (view with fixed font!):

\gp--v--q\g
\g|  |  |\g
\g>--+--<\g
\g|  |  |\g
\gb--^--d\g

Will draw a box with an intersecting horizonal and vertical line..

Note - you'll need to set EXTENDED_GRAPHICS before you compile the form as
well as for the 4gl executable...


=============================================================================
Aubit was honouring the size y by x in the form, this has been removed.

If you require to specify the size, it can still be used by setting
A4GL_USE_FORM_SIZE=Y (using this is an aubit extension - and not default
informix behaviour!)


=============================================================================
I'm going to start work on some test scripts soon and I needed a mechanism for
doing some automated testing...

I've added two new environment settings

	export A4GL_KEYFILE=(some filename in DBPATH)
	export A4GL_KEYDELAY=(time in usec 1000000 = 1 second, defaults to 0.1s)



=============================================================================


In order to reduce the possibility of breaking something when fixing something
else, I've started to create a set of test scripts (as I said before) they
can be found in :

tools/test/build_tests

(Currently they just have numerical ids..)

We are going to need **a lot** of these - so feel free to add any you want to
run before we build a new release (I'm currently running these scripts before
I do a commit to sf).

All you need is a makefile which implements a 'run' (a 'compile' and a 'clean'
would be nice too though!)

Eg:

expr.4ae: expr.4gl
        4glpc expr.4gl -o expr.4ae

compile: expr.4ae

run: expr.4ae
        sh ./run_expr


(Here run_expr is a script which executes the .4ae and does a 'diff' on what
we get and what we expected...)


If you're going to add any - just make sure to keep them small and to the
point, I'd rather have 10 tests than one exceedingly complicated one...


To run them just 'cd' to tools/test/build_tests and 'sh run_tests'


It may be ncurses specific for some of the tests (checking colours etc) and
have only been done on linux (so far) - so don't be suprised if you get
failures on windows or other unix, we'll just need to sort them out as they
come along..


For access to databases - you can assume a database exists called 'test1' (you
can't assume it has any tables though!)


Note :
If you don't have CVS write access - just email them to me :

	buildtests@aubit.com

and I'll put them up..


=============================================================================


The easiest way to connect to an informix database is to install the informix
Client SDK.
You can then use set the A4GL_LEXTYPE environment variable :

$ export A4GL_LEXTYPE=EC

You should then be able to compile your programs :

4glpc myprog.4gl -o myprog.4ae

And it will write and compile a .ec file using esql

In your other message - you mentioned postgres - you can do this using ESQL/C
using ecpg..

You'll need to tell aubit :

export A4GL_LEXDIALECT=POSTGRES

(LEXDIALECT defaults to INFORMIX)


If you want to connect via ODBC - you'll need to install and configure and ODBC
driver - which very much depends on which one you choose...

Don't know - I'd just leave this out for now - most of the changes will be in

So I'd probably wait and check for that..

These are used by the generic packers to detail the format of the output and
are required for a binary dist.

> lib/libesqlhelper_funcs.so

This is a set of functions that copy from and to a native datatype and Aubits.
For example - decimal - Informix, Postgres and Aubit have different types for
this, we need to copy from the database type to something neutral (like a
string for example), then down to Aubit, or from Aubit to something neutral
and down to a database type.
When compiling Aubit down to esql/ecpg - you need to add -lesqlhelper_funcs to
get these included (otherwise you get missing A4GL_copy_datatype functions).
Depending on which database you are targetting - you'd use a different
esqlhelper_funcs..
The one thats there at the minute compiles fine for Informix and Postgres.

These are used by the XDR packers (in the same way as the libDATA stuff is for
Generic) and are required for a binary dist.

Subject: Informix to PostgreSQL (JDBC)
From: "Nicolas Bazin" <nbazin@ingenico.com.au>
Date: Fri, 12 Apr 2002 10:31:16 +1000

Just to let you know that you can use the transfer tool of the hsqldb JAVA database to transfer database from Informix to Postgres. I have used it  to transfer my application from IDS 7.3 to Postgres 7.2.1. Because it relies on JDBC, it can be used/expended to support other databases.

It supports:
- tables structure creation,
- default field value,
- index creation (unique or not),
- data transfer,
- foreign keys creation,
- it supports schema (to read the source)
- autoincrement fields

As it's  based on JDBC, it cannot extract VIEWs or store procedures. User privilege are not created even though it is available from the JDBC.
A further extension would then be:
support of GRANT and also the possibility to transfer to a specific schema.

You can download it at http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/hsqldb/hsqldb_1_7_0_RC4.zip
The transfer tool is independent of the database. It's in the src/org/hsqldb/util directory you also need the src/org/hsqldb/lib directory.


==============================================================================

I've added

	SCHEMA dbname

to aubit4gl...

You'll probably find some of the invalid statements were invalid in postgres
and some work around has been added:


A4GL_USE_INDICATOR=YES
Adds indicators to SQL statements to check for nulls


A4GL_ESQL_UNLOAD=YES
Uses UNLOAD within ESQL if supported


A4GL_USE_ALIAS_AS=YES
Uses the 'AS' keyword for select column aliases , eg

select tabid tid from systables -> select tabid AS 'tid' from systables


A4GL_FIXUPDATE=YES
Rewrites the Update (col1,col2,col3)=(val1,val2,val3) -> update
col1=val1,col2=val2,col3=val3



A4GL_SQL_CURRENT_FUNCTION=somename
When SQL encounters CURRENT  - it calls this function instead with two string
parameters ('START' to 'END')

select current year to minute from systables where tabid=1 ->
select somename('year','minute') from systables where tabid=1



A4GL_OMIT_NO_LOG=YES
This does not include the ' WITH NO LOG' at the end of a create temp table
when the original SQL does.
create temp table a(a integer) WITH NO LOG ->
	create temp table a(a integer)



You'll also need to write a a4gl_esql_sapdb.h and edit a4gl_esql.h to include
it.
If you don't - it defaults to using informix's version

You'll also need to create an esqlhelper_funcs version to copy between sapdb
datatypes and aubit datatypes..

===========================================================================


I just committed SQLite ODBC driver and native connector plug-in support for Aubit compiler.

http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/

From the home page:

"SQLite is a C library that implements an embeddable SQL database engine. Programs that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database access without running a separate RDBMS process. The distribution comes with a standalone command-line access program (sqlite) that can be used to administer an SQLite database and which serves as an example of how to use the SQLite library.

SQLite is not a client library used to connect to a big database server. SQLite is the server. The SQLite library reads and writes directly to and from the database files on disk."

This should be the easiest way to get database support for Aubit so far - SQLite is a full SQL database engine (RDBMS) in single shared library. Key advantages over traditional RDBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL or Informix are:

1) No need to install/configure ANY database engine to use/compile/develop with Aubit compiler - just drop one library file on your system, and you have database engine to use!

2) When using native connectivity to SQLite - no messing with database connectivity - no ODBC, no ESQL/C - nothing to do and nothing to go wrong. When using ODBC, I hope that following provided instructions should be simple enough.

3) You can create self sufficient distribution of your 4GL application - compile your 4GL code with Aubit compiler, add that and Aubit run-time (which will include SQLite engine library) to your package and your users/customers will be able to install and run your app in no time. You can even distribute your app with demo database with demo data.

4) Exchange of databases - SQLite databases are stored in just one file, and this file is portable between systems. This among other applications will be great for debugging.

5) SQLite is EXTREMELY fast, even faster then MySQL

Limitations:

a) See SQLite home page for SQL language limitations. Very few.

b) I did not see this explicitly stated, but I assume that SQLite is a single-user database.

TO-DO:

* Find out why Aubit generates "Error: Could not disconnect from database" when program exits.
* Test SQL compatibility
* use $DBPATH to find SQLite .db file, so that user don't have to specify full path & file name in DATABASE statement. Append .db extension automatically. DATABASE 'xyz' should be resolved to <full_path>xyz.db before calling dbopen()

HOW-TO
------

This instructions are for Linux/Intel, RPM based distributions ONLY.

0) update Aubit source code (from CVS or tgz file once it's refreshed)

1) Only if you wish to use ODBC connection:
If you are not sure if you have unixODBC or iODBC ODBC manager installed, run "./configure" to find out. Examine it's output, you should see:

Checking for iODBC support:
checking for main in -liodbc... yes

and/or

Checking for unixODBC support:
checking for main in -lodbc... yes
checking for sql.h... yes
checking for sqlext.h... yes
checking for odbcinst.h... yes

If you don't, install iODBC or unixODBC manager. SQLite ODBC driver uses there header files to compile, and on top of that, links created ODBC driver library with manager libraries. Don't ask why... Aubit native SQLite plug-in uses ODBC headers from Aubit source code tree, and does not link with anything other then SQLite itself, so you don't need to install anything else.

You can try using "make install.iodbc" and/or "make install.unixodbc"

1b) If you did not allready (in step 1), run ./configure to refresh make files.

2) Install SQLite: "make install.sqlite"

3) Install SQLite ODBC driver: "make install.sqlite.odbc" if you wish to use SQLite ODBC connector.

4) run "./configure". This will check for SQLite and SQLite ODBC driver, create SQLite test database (in tools/aubit.db) and add needed entry in your /etc/odbc.ini - you will need to be user "root" to do that! You should see:

Checking for SQLite library support:
checking for sqlite... /usr/bin/sqlite
checking for main in -lsqlite... yes
checking for sqlite.h... yes
checking for sqlite_libversion in -lsqlite... yes
checking for default SQLite database... Created in tools/aubit.db

Checking for SQLite ODBC library support:
checking for main in -lsqliteodbc... yes
checking for default SQLite odbc.ini entry... Added

5) run "make clean.all; make" to create Aubit SQLITE ODBC plug-in and compile Aubit source code.

6) run "make install"

7) run "test.sqlite". You should see message:

	"Aubit native connection to SQLite successful."

  If you installed SQLite ODBC, run "test.sqlite.odbc". You should see message:

	"Aubit connection to SQLite via ODBC successful."

Let me know if you don't...

Note: to use SQLite ODBC connection from your 4GL code, you will need to make sure that
A4GL_LEXTYPE=C and A4GL_SQLTYPE=sqliteodbc when compiling/running your 4GL code.

To use SQLite native connector, set A4GL_LEXTYPE=C and A4GL_SQLTYPE=sqlite (or A4GL_SQLTYPE=sqliteS for statically linked one)

Aubit native SQLite plug-in is built in two variants; dynamically linked against SQLite (libSQL_sqlite.so) and statically with SQLite engine (libSQL_sqliteS.so). Static one is primarily intended for distribution with Aubit binary distros (tgz, rpm and Windows installer).

Note #2: Aubit native SQLite connector plug-in is really a cheat: Aubit ODBC connector is linked together with modified code of SQLite ODBC driver to create it. So Aubit code calls API_sql, which calls Aubit ODBC plug-in code, which calls SQLite ODBC code, which calls SQLite library functions. I could make it a separate plug-in by replacing the ODBC calls with actual code form ODBC driver, but because of the nature of how SQLite works, I can see no motivation to do so.

Some hints:

If your connection via ODBC fails (with a message like "Error: Could not connect to database" from Aubit programs) use "isql" (this is NOT Informix "isql" - it's part of unixODBC package) tool to test your ODBC connection (if you installed unixODBC) or Aubit provide tools in "tools/odbctest"

Use "sqlite" tool to manipulate SQLite databases (see "sqlite -help"). You could also use Aubit provided equivalent of dbaccess, called misql.4ae (see tools/adbaccess) or your favorite ODBC front-end.

Why should you care about Aubit ODBC plug-ins for specific ODBC RDBMS sources, when you can connect to any ODBC source using ODBC managers anyway: Because not everyone will have ODBC manager installed on all systems.

Why should you care about native connectors, when you can connect via ODBC: Because ODBC connectivity, both direct and via ODBC managers will require ODBC driver for particular RDBMS to be installed on the system.

Why should you care about ODBC connectivity when you have native plug-in: because when using native plug-in you will only be able connect to that particular RDBMS at the same time, since Aubit does not have connection management (yet). OTOH, ODBC manager do, so you can open and use connections to different RDBMS at the same time.

Why should you care about any other method of connection to RDBMS when you can use Aubit ESQL/C output to perform connectivity (informix, PostgreSQL and SAP DB): Because code compiled that way will be able to connect ONLY to that RDBMS, and will need full recompile to change back-end RDBMS.

Why should you care about ESQL/C output, when you have native/and or ODBC connectors: because native ESQL/C compilers can work much close to the RDBMS API, allowing target-specific functionality not possible via ODBC or connection library API. For example, by using Aubit PostgreSQL EC output, your code can use most Informix specific SQL statements against PostgreSQL RDBMS (note: requires latest CVS version of PostgreSQL EC compiler (V 3.0), and patched PostgreSQL engine - at the moment, untill 7.4 is released)

============================================================================

PostgreSQL Informix comatibility:

> can you please comment on level of Informix SQL dialect compatibility that PG patched this way will have? Exceptions?
>
> Also, what are the chances to get this patches accepted in PG CVS?

We haven't done too much towards dialect compatibility;

update foo set (c1,c2,...) = ( v1, v2, ...) is now supported
select .... into table is somewhat supported
some aliases for things like today have been added
load/unload ala informix have been added
where current of on a with hold cursor is functional.

much of the compatibility is realized with ecpg.

There still remains a fundamental difference in the way postgres handles
transactions ( ie MVCC)

some of these patches may never make it into CVS, they likely won't make
it for 7.4, we were too late.
