Simple guide to debugging
-------------------------


Debugging in Aubit4gl is more complicated that using the 
PCODE interactive debugger - this is because we compile to C 
and not to PCODE!

We therefore need to use the 'C' debugger - gdb

In order to put the 'debugging symbols' into the output file - we need to recompile
our 4gl programs with the -g option :


	4glpc -g m1.4gl -o m1

You can then run the program within the debugger using gdb : 

$ gdb ./m1
gdb> run m1

This is quite useful - but you'll see the generated C code in the debugger rather than
the 4gl you started with.
In order to fix this - we can set an environment variable: 

	$ export A4GL_INCLINES=Y

This instructs the Aubit4gl compile to insert extra lines into the C output that it generated
which indicate which original 4GL lines the C code relates to.

You then need to recompile your 4gl programs to get a debuggable program : 

	$ export A4GL_INCLINES=Y
	$ 4glpc -g m1.4gl -o m1
	$ gdb ./m1



Clobbering
----------

One 'feature' of aubit4gl is that it 'Clobbers' function names. 
For example, take a function called 'foo' 

	FUNCTION foo()
		DISPLAY "Hello World"
	END FUNCTION

Aubit4gl will rename this function at compile time to include a 'namespace' prefix.
By default this is 'aclfgl_'. This means that in the C code the function will be 'aclfgl_foo' 
and not just 'foo'. This is important because if you are using gdb to debug the program, you will only
be able to use the 'aclfgl_foo' name for debugging.




Debugging a program which uses windows & forms etc
--------------------------------------------------

Standard gdb debugging will work for screens/windows/forms etc - but will
be difficult to use because of switching between gdb (in line mode) and the
4gl program in screen mode. The gdb messages will appear over the top of the
screen and make it difficult to use any underlying menu/form etc..

Eg..

ADBACCESS:   Query-language  Connection  Database  Table  Session  ...

   Query-language  Connection 


One way around this is to use gdb from another terminal window. In that way - you can start the 4gl program as normal, then attach to it via its process ID - keeping the two sessions separate..

Eg.  Imagine our program is called 'm1' - we can run it in one xterm, then use 
'ps' to find the process id, then attach using gdb -p pid on another xterm

Xterm1

	$ ./m1
	+-------------+
	|             |
	|             |
	|             |
	+-------------+

Xterm2

	$ ps ax | grep m1
	14079 pts/5    S+     0:00 grep m1
	$ gdb -p 14079
	gdb> 


This keeps xterm1 in screen mode all the time, and xterm2 in line mode all the
time - without any gdb messages appearing on xterm1 to 'mess it up'.

NOTE: You will need to ensure 'xterm1' has the focus again when entering information or using a 4gl menu!






Simple GDB commands
-------------------

run 		- Run the program
run arg1 arg2	- Run the program with arguments
br function 	- break when going calling 'function' (dont forget the aclfgl_ prefix)
cont		- continue execution after a breakpoint
step		- step through the program (will step into functions if required)
next		- step through the program (will NOT step into functions)
list		- list the next few lines of the program
list -		- list the last few lines of the program
watch variable  - break when 'variable' changes
print variable  - prints the contents of a variable	
bt		- 'backtrace':list all the calls up to this one
			This will not list the actual parameters passed - as
			4gl passes only the number of parameters at C level
help		- help with gdb!


Some useful internals : 
	
	print a4gl_sqlca.sqlcode
	print a4gl_status

	print A4GLSTK_getStackTrace() 
		prints the 4gl stack trace (includes parameters!)
