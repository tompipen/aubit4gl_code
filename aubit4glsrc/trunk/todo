4GL compiler/libraries
----------------------
	Interval and datetime arithmetic...
	Clean up error handling
	Replace sqlca & status with acl_sqlca and acl_status -  use as sqlca&status in 4GL code
		(This will allow other DBs to still have their own sqlca - which may be different). ** PARTIAL
	fix PACKER=PACKED on MinGW (see test 11/y.per) (-xml)
	find out what is causing different spaces in reports (-nospace) (see test #24)

Enhancements
------------
	1) Adding OO to aubit4GL (without breaking the rest of it)
	This would be both academic and practical - what OO features would be
	applicable, how would they be wrapped up etc

	2) GUI
	I'd like to have a native and client/server GUI, we have a sort of former, but
	not too much of the latter.


	3) Alternate/innovative DB (eg. what about one that could read flat files)
		select uid,username from /etc/password

	4) Java output mode/port of libaubit4gl ?

	5) Anything that wraps up complex programming in a simple way (ie the 4GL way
	of doing things, hard things easy - but only when within the confines of the
	language)

	6) Language bindings for database operations.
	I like my SELECT .. USING
	At the minute the program doesn't know too much about the database, its
	linkages etc. I'd like to extend this, so it could use some data dictionary
	to work out where clauses, apply validation etc.

	7) isql perform form handling, written in 4GL (and extending libaubit4gl/libui
	where required)..
	We've got the ace report handling



ESQL/C
------
	Fix OPEN USING in esql/c (in sql)
	Other fixes in ESQL/C output driver


FIXME's (in DoxyGen comments)
-------
	Fix 'em
    TODO's - Do them (See DoxyGen @todo tags at http://www.falout.com/projects/Aubit4GL/doxy/html/pages.html )


GTK
----
	Make it work - start with tools/test/gui code


Other unimplemented functions
-----------------------------
	put_insert *partial


SQL Parser
----------
	Separate SQL parser into different YACC file (to allow for multiple SQL dialects)
	Bind substrings (also used in displays/inputs) ******** PARTIAL (Generates but not coded in library)
	implement grant and revoke


SQL plugins
-----------
    unixODBC bug (see bug db on SF)
    Finish native PostgreSQL plugin (Sergio), create SAP DB native
    show error when SQLUID/SQLPWD is not set on DEFINE ... LIKE
    Handle DSN-less connections (should be able to connect using CONNECT stmt, even without explicit DSN in odbc.ini)
    Before using SQLUID and SQLPWD, odbc.ini should be examined for default username/password (?!!! - are you sure ?! - Yes I am, see example in SQLite ODBC code)
	fix SQLite on MinGW (core dump) (-nodb)
	fix/finish pg native driver
	add SQL conversion for SAPODBC
	fix test 100 (insert cursor/temp table/insert...select) - WORKS ONLY WITH Informix ESQL/C (-eci)
	SQLite fails on ORDER BY in REPORT block (test 14)

ACE
----
	ace now uses xgen - enable Windows make files (this was doen I think?)
    Integrate ACE in asql

XML-RPC
-------
	create server part

TUI
----
	General cleanups..
    	Windows TUI uses strange characters

    	DISPLAY without AT erises the screen completely - sends to stdout
		- should display _OVER_ existing display/screen
		(** THIS IS CURSES FAULT **NOT** Aubit... - BUT IT'S STILL INCOMPATIBLE!)
	find out why on MinGW/Cygwin graphic characters are different (-nographic)
	fix curses on MinGW



PERL
----
	fix "make perl"

CVS
----
    start branch tagging in CVS

Build system & make files
-------------------------
    Create commit and update targets to handle CVS commits and updates
    in Commit:
		handle update of no_yacc, no_perl...etc files before commit
        handle build number
    in Update:
		handle "configure" file to prevent meaningless merginig


MANUALS
--------
	need complete update
    archtecture diagram needs update for libPACKER, LEX_EC, SQL_PG...

WEBSITE
-------
	Replace current static pages with PostNuke or Xaraya

PACKAGING
---------
    create .deb (use Alien?)

MISC
-----
    fix all compiler warnings
	add "#ifdef DEBUG" arround _ALL_ debug() calls
    complete DoxyGen function & variable comments
    enter lclint descriptions to enable full lclint checking
    fix Splint (lclint) warnings and extend to all libraries
    check that "make extra" works
    check code in tools/test/regression
    Review & clean bugs in bugs database on SourceForge
    create 4gl program to create .schema files from systables data as 4gl report
		[table1]
		column datatype size
		column datatype size
		[table2]
		column datatype size

    remove lib/liblex/lex_c from CVS

Windows port
-------------
    export SQLCA explicitly - cannot be auto-imported (Done I think)


BUILD TESTS
-----------
    p-code enable all tests using makefile in template/
    See list of errors in run_test script


Ad-Hoc Bug Fixes
----------------
    See BUGS.txt and http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=32409&atid=405150
