This should really be adbaccess - but that was already taken...


YOU MUST SET 

	A4GL_LEXTYPE=EC
and
	A4GL_USE_DATABASE_STMT=Y

before compiling!



To compile the postgres version you must also set

	A4GL_LEXDIALECT=POSTGRES

and make with
	make asql_p.4ae



You can then copy asql_p.4ae to be anything you want...
