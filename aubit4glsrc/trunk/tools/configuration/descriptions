A4GL_AUTOBANG UI/TUI/MENU  Enable automatic ! for command entry
=YES|NO
	(like dbaccess menus) for all applicable statements
A4GL_CINT COMPILE/RUNTIME Full path to CINT C-code interpreter
	Full path to CINT, if installed, othewise 'no'. Used by 4glc compiler to run
	C compiled code after compilation.
A4GL_C_COMP COMPILE Name of the executable of C compiler to use
	Note that 4glpc uses $CC
A4GL_EXE_EXT COMPILE Extension to use for executable files compiled by Aubit compiler
	Aubit default extensions for compiled resources (forms,menus,help) and objects
	as used by Amake _AND_ Aubit compiler (see resources.c)
	Amake does NOT read this file (?-check)
	note that composite variables A4GL_FRM_EXT and A4GL_MNU_EXT exist only in/for
	Amake defaults:
	A4GL_MNU_BASE_EXT=.mnu
	A4GL_HLP_EXT=.hlp
	A4GL_FRM_BASE_EXT=.afr
	A4GL_XML_EXT=.xml
	A4GL_PACKED_EXT=.dat

	A4GL_LIB_EXT=.aox
	A4GL_SOB_EXT=.aso
	A4GL_SOL_EXT=.asx
	A4GL_EXE_EXT=.4ae
	To emulate Informix p-code extensions (for instance, to re-use legacy make
	files) you would use this settings; note that doing this is not recomended
	and that created files will still be in Aubit format, not Informix one:
	A4GL_MNU_EXT=<no equivalent>
	A4GL_HLP_EXT=.iem
	A4GL_FRM_BASE_EXT=.frm
	A4GL_XML_EXT=''
	A4GL_PACKED_EXT=''

$AUBITDIR/lib/libLEX_?.so
	Default output language driver for 4gl compiler:
	When used: compile-time only
	Options: (C), PERL, EC, CS
	Note: EC (Embedded SQL C) can be Informix ESQL/C, SAP DB pre-compiler, Querix
	esqlc or PostgreSQL ecpg.
	using EC will limit Aubit DB connectivity at run-time to that of used EC compiler, ignoring
	setting of A4GL_SQLTYPE
	Note: CS is C#

A4GL_OBJ_EXT COMPILE extension to use when compiling 4GL modules to objects
A4GL_OMIT_NO_LOG
A4GL_PACKED_EXT COMPILE/RUNTIME Determine file extension for packing
A4GL_PACKER MENU/FORMS/HELP/COMPILE/RUNTIME Determine library for packing forms/menus/help etc
$AUBITDIR/lib/libPACKER_?.so
	You can select which packer to use by setting the variable 'A4GL_PACKER'
	 1) (PACKED)  - default
	  This is very similar to XDR in that data is written in a hopefully portable
	 way (optionally non-portable if the required functions aren't available).
	 This will probably give the smallest output files
	 2) XDR
	  This is the same as doing it the old way
	 3) XML
	  This stores and reads the data in an XML file. The reading is very limited
	 and can basically only read the XML files that it generates - IT IS NOT A
	 FULL BLOWN XML PARSER. It uses some odd constructs and isn't ideal - but
	 you'll get the idea when you see the output. Size of created files is
	 much larger then PACKED or XDR
	 4) PERL
	 This generates a data structure which can be used inside a perl program - its
	 pretty complicated stuff though using hashes for the data representation.
	 What you do with it after you've generated it is up to you, because this is
	 an output only library (ie it can't read back what its written).


A4GL_PDFTYPE REPORT/RUNTIME Determine which library to use for extended reports
$AUBITDIR/lib/libEXREPORT_?.so
	Determine default driver for Extended Reporting
	When used: run-time only
	Options: PDF, (NOPDF)

	Used to determine if traditionaly reserved words in 4GL language should be treated as reserverd
	Procesing of reserved word is experimental. Set this to YES, if you want to
	disable this functionality. When set to NO, compiler will try to process
	most reserved words, instead of reporting the error.

A4GL_RM_CMD COMPILE Command to use for deleting files on the file system
A4GL_SAPDB_ESQLC ESQL/COMPILE Full path to SAP DB ESQL/C compiler
	full path to SAP-DB ESQL/C pre-compiler executable used when compiling EC output for
	SAP DB(does not have to be in the path)
A4GL_SQLTYPE SQL/RUNTIME/COMPILE Determine which library to use to connect to the database
$AUBITDIR/libSQL_?.so
	Name of default SQL library plug-in to use.
	When used: run-time and compile-time
	Options: (nosql)
	   <ODBC MANAGERS> iodbc unixodbc odbc32 (Windows only)
		<DIRECT ODBC> 	ifxodbc pgodbc  sapodbc sqliteodbc
	   <NATIVE> 		esql esqpPG esqlSAP esqlQ sqlite sqliteS pg
		<SPECIAL> 		FILESCHEMA
	FILESCHEMA is to be used for compiling programs where either the database
	doesn't exist yet - or you can't get immediate access to it.
	This takes the 'database' as a filename (with a .schema extension) and uses
	that to collect the data used by compiler(s)
	Warning: this setting is ignored at run-rime when A4GL_LEXTYPE is set to 'EC'.
	At compile time, it is used by compilers segardless of A4GL_LEXTYPE setting

A4GL_ANSI_ERROR SQL/COMPILE ANSI SQL 92 error checking mode
	When ANSI_ERROR is set to Yes, compiler will abort if non ANSI SQL 92 statemt
	is found in source code (Static SQL only).
	If neither A4GL_ANSI_WARN or A4GL_ANSI_ERROR is set, no checking is performed.
A4GL_ANSI_WARN SQL/COMPILE ANSI SQL 92 warning checking mode
	When ANSI_WARN is set to Yes compiler will display a warning if it encounters
	static SQL statement not confitming to ANSI SQL 92 specification
	If neither A4GL_ANSI_WARN or A4GL_ANSI_ERROR is set, no checking is performed.

	eg if year=1997
	n=20   > 17 will be taken as historic anything <17 is future
	n=-20  <77 will be taken as future >77 is in the past
	XX00 - always use century XX
	999  - Do not add anything - dealing with AD 0-99
	-999 - use current century
A4GL_AUTONULL COMPILE Auto initializing module and function local variables

	Applies to asql only?
A4GL_DBPATH RUNTIME/COMPILE Path to look in for databases and resource files
    See 'DBPATH' for more information
DBPATH SQL/HELP/FORMS/MENU/RUNTIME/COMPILE Path to look in for databases and resource files
	DBPATH variable containls list of directory(es) that will be searched for objects
	like compiled form, help and menu files, and SQLite databases. Use coloumn (:)
	as a delimiter between paths you want searched, (;) on Windows.
	Default: tools/ in Aubit source code root directory and tools/ in Aubit binary
	installation directory
	As oposed to most Aubit settings that are exclusive and order of there surce
	(environment, aubitrc, built-in resources) decides which one will prevail,
	DBPATH and A4GL_DBPATH are cumulated from both variables, and added one to
	another in order depending on there source. So if you have path 1 in
	environment variable A4GL_DBPATH path 2 in environment variable DBPATH, path 3
	in A4GL_DBPATH in aubitrc, path 4 in DBPATH in aubitrc, cumulated value will
	look like this: 1:2:3:4. Search for the file in DBPATH will then be performed
	from left to right, and first path found to contain file looked for will be used.
	NOTE: DBPATH to xxx/incl is for adbaccess form files
	Only SQLite databases are serched for usign DBPATH. Resources file are:
	compiled forms/menus/help/p-code files


DBPRINT PRINT/RUNTIME/REPORT Printing command

	START REPORT ... TO PRINTER
A4GL_DEBUG DEBUG/COMPILE/RUNTIME Log extensive information for tracing bugs in Aubit4gl code
	When you encouter programs that crash, use this for debugging - it will
	create file 'debug.out' that can be very usefull when you don't get core
	dump, so you don't have file 'core' to run 'gdb' on. WARNING: do not set
	this under normal circumstanced - all programs will create debug.out file
	when they run, files can be VERY large, and they will slow down progrms
	execution considerably. This setting applies to all Aubit compiler
	executables (includign all compilers) and to all 4gl programs compiled
	with Aubit compiler.
	FIXME: we should have separate settings for compilers and compiled programs,
	like A4GL_DEBUG_COMP and A4GL_DEBUG_PRG
	FIXME: add note about priority numbers

	If set to Y allows forms to contain the additional graphics characters
	<,>,^,v, and + to be used for tee's and an intersection.
	So the following :
	\gp--v--q\g
	\g|  |  |\g
	\g>--+--<\g
	\g|  |  |\g
	\gb--^--d\g
	Will draw a box with an intersecting horizonal and vertical line.
	Note - you'll need to set this before you compile the form as
	well as when you run program that will use form file compiled this way

	proper borders (if available)

A4GL_SQLCNVPATH RUNTIME/SQL Specifies the location of the conversion details for SQL grammers
	CONFIG FILE BASED CONVERSIONS
	convert_sql() now uses configuration files.  These are by default

	with A4GL_SQLCNVPATH.

A4GL_SQLCONVERT COMPILE/RUNTIME/SQL Autoconvert SQL from sources files dialect to runtime dialect
	Conversion of SQL statements in 4GL code, to the SQL dialect of target RDBMS

	see example testmpz.4gl into the tools/test directory.
A4GL_NULL_DECIMAL_IF_BAD RUNTIME Null a decimal value rather than set it to 0 if its invalid
=YES|NO
	The standard informix behaviour seems to be to set the value to 0 for decimals
	but sets dates to NULL. This is inconsistent and so this default behaviour is switchable
	via this configuration setting
A4GL_BEEPONERROR RUNTIME Indicates that a beep should be emitted by the ERROR statement
=YES|NO
A4GL_FLASHONERROR RUNTIME Indicates that a screen flash should be emitted by the ERROR statement
=YES|NO

	doesn't suffer from this problem then set this to N
A4GL_FIRSTCOL_ONERR UI/TUI Move to the beginning of a field after an error
=YES|NO
	Can only be set if CLR_FIELD_ON_ERROR=N
	See CLR_FIELD_ON_ERROR

=YES|NO
	In Informix 4GL, the screen is not refreshed after every system command but only
	after a new screen instruction is issued. This means that if you are running a lot
	of system commands, Aubit4GL's screen may appear to flicker between line mode
	and screen mode. Set this to N to inhibit the automatic screen refresh.
A4GL_NO_ARRAY_EXPAND COMPILE Remove the array expansion code
=YES|NO
	This is solely for backward compatibilty with older Aubit4GL versions.
	It should be set to N in all other cases..
RM_COMMENTS_FIRST COMPILE remove any comments before compiling the 4GL code
=YES|NO
	This defaults to Yes, if you have problems with compilation - it may be
	that this code is getting confused. Try setting to N, or setting DUMP_LAST
GDB_ATTACH RUNTIME Attach GDB to the process when a Segmentation Fault occurs
=YES|NO
	This is useful for tracing back problems during runtime execution
	The first command to execute in gdb would normally be a 'bt' which should give
	something like :
	#0  0x402095a9 in __wait4 () from /lib/libc.so.6
	#1  0x40271ad8 in __DTOR_END__ () from /lib/libc.so.6
	#2  0x401ad506 in system () from /lib/libc.so.6
	#3  0x40038858 in A4GL_core_dump () at fglwrap.c:911
	#4  <signal handler called>
	#5  0x8048bbd in aclfgl_xxx (_nargs=0) at ./x1.c:95
	#6  0x8048a6d in main (argc=1, argv=0xbffff1d4) at ./x1.c:58
	#7  0x40180baf in __libc_start_main () from /lib/libc.so.6
	Ignore everything up to the <signal handler called>, and 'frame 5' (in this case)
	should show the offending line..
NO_ALT_SCR RUNTIME/TUI Try to disable the alternate screen (for xterm and console)
=YES|NO
	When using some terminals types in curses mode, an alternate screen is employed so that
	when the application finishes (or otherwise enters line mode), the original screen will 
	be redisplayed. Setting this option attempts to disable this screen swapping so that the
	original screen is used for the 4GL display.
DUMP_LAST COMPILE output the results of the last remove comments
=YES|NO
	This will produce a file 'last' which contains the file with the comments
	removed. This is used to check the operation of the RM_COMMENTS_FIRST code
