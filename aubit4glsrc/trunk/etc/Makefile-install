#This file gets installed to root of binary installation, under name "Makefile"
#in all scenarios of binary installation (tgz tarball, .package installer, RPM package, 
#or by executing "make install" from source code tree...) on Linux/UNIX.
#
#It's purpose is to 
#	* create aubitrc for binary installation by running ./configure
#     as etc/aubitrc-bin
#	* install aubitrc it to appropriate place (copy etc/aubitrc-bin)
#   * and create links to binary files and libraries.
#	* set environment variables needed by Aubit tools
# See help target below (or run 'make help') for details
