#This file gets installed to root of binary installation, under name "Makefile"
#It's purpose is to create aubitrc for binary installation, and install
#it to appropriate place, and create links to binary files and libraries.


#All stuff common to more then one Aubit compiler make file is there:
include incl/Makefile-common

include incl/Makefile-install.mki

#we have to remove aubitrc created by configure, so it don't override
#the one installed in /etc/opt/aubit4gl/aubitrc.
#we don't have to do this any more, since it's now named aubitrc-bin
#remove.aubitrc:
#	mv etc/aubitrc-bin etc/aubitrc-bin.original
