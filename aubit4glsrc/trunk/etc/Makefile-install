#This file gets installed to root of binary installation, under name "Makefile"
#It's purpose is to create aubitrc for binary installation, and install
#it to appropriate place, and create links to binary files and libraries.


#All stuff common to more then one Aubit compiler make file is there:
include incl/Makefile-common

install: config install.links install.aubitrc install.libs.links test \
		remove.aubitrc

#install.libs.conf
	@echo Aubit compiler binary disrtibution installed.

config:
	./configure ${CPARAM}

include incl/Makefile-install.mki

#we have to remove aubitrc created by configure, so it don't override
#the one installed in /etc/opt/aubit4gl/aubitrc.
remove.aubitrc:
	mv etc/aubitrc etc/aubitrc.original

tar: clean
#COMPILE_DATE=20-01-2002
#TARGET=i586-pc-linux-gnu
	${RM} aubit4gl-bin-${TARGET}-${AUBIT_VERSION}.${AUBIT_BUILD}.tgz
	tar -cvzf aubit4gl-bin-${TARGET}-${AUBIT_VERSION}.${AUBIT_BUILD}.tgz *
	@echo "Aubit binary installation tarball created"

clean:
	${RM} config.status config.log etc/aubitrc.original
	make -C tools/test clean
	make -C tools/test/gui clean
	@echo "Aubit binary installation now clean"

deinstall: deinstall.libs.links deinstall.bin.links
	@echo "All Aubit related links/files outside this tree removed."
	@echo "If you wish to deinstall completely, just remove this directory"
	@echo "Note that /etc/opt/aubit4g;/aubitrc configuration file WAS NOT removed"
	@echo "You can also use 'deinstall.all' to remove all files from"
	@echo "Aubit installation tree selectively, as they where installed, but "
	@echo "preserve all files created after installation."

help:

	@echo "execute 'make' to install Aubit compiler on your system."
	@echo "You can specify flags to 'configure' using, for example: "
	@echo "    make CPARAM=--with-iodbc[=<path>]"
	@echo "Options:"
	@echo ""
	@echo "install - install binary distribuiton on your system (same as just 'make')"
	@echo "clean - clean Aubit binary distribution installation tree"
	@echo "tar - create tar archive of Aubit binary distribution installation tree"
	@echo "zip - create zip archive of Aubit binary distribution installation tree"
	@echo "config - scan the system for installed options, create aubitrc configuration file"
