#This file gets installed to root of binary installation, under name "Makefile"
#in all scenarios of binary installation (tgz package, RPM package, executing
#"make install" from source code tree...).
#It's purpose is to create aubitrc for binary installation, install
#it to appropriate place, and create links to binary files and libraries.
