This is the directory which contains import packages.
Import packages allow the coder to use shared libraries without linking 
and without requiring the full library::function(...) syntax.


Just include the line :


import package package-name

at the top of your module, this will read the file from this directory called 'package-name'


Package file syntax
-------------------


LIBRARY-NAME FUNCTION-NAME

A package may contain functions from more than one library...

eg:

	a4gl_pcre :

		A4GL_pcre pcre_match
		A4GL_pcre pcre_text




Usage :


import package a4gl_pcre

main
	if pcre_match("cat|dog","there was a cat") then
		display "Matched to :", pcre_text(1)
	end if
end main





If you didn't do the import then it would look like :

main
	if a4gl_pcre::pcre_match("cat|dog","there was a cat") then
		display "Matched to ", a4gl_pcre::pcre_text(1)
	end if
end main




The package mechanism will later be extended to allow conditional loading, something like:

a4gl_sqllib:ENV(SQLTYPE) sql_connect

The exact syntax and scope has yet to be discussed - but this should allow conditional loading of a library module


Take for example :

	a4gl_lang:ENV(A4GL_LANG) get_msg


you could have 

	$ export A4GL_LANG=english
and then it would call get_msg in a4gl_lang_english.so

or
	$ export A4GL_LANG=french
and then it would call get_msg in a4gl_lang_french.so

etc...


This functionality isn't available using the current mechanisms, 
other than by linking the shared library to some common name - but this restricts usage to 
one categeory on one server...
