# rules for converting Informix SQL to DB2 for VM (SQLDS/VM)-compatible syntax
#
# WARNING: NOT COMPLETED YET
# COPIED FROM INFORMIX-DB2.cnv and modified
# Not everything was tested on DB2 for VM
#
# Process ODBC type 12 (LONGVARCHAR) as 0 (CHAR)
# that effects in generating char C type instead of fgltext.
# This is done because in DB2/VM max length of a VARCHAR is 255 and 
# DB2 implicitly creates LONGVARCHAR (=clob/text) column instead.
# Aubit does not handle substring [] operations on LONGVARCHAR
# (probably correct behavior). This can be considered as only
# a somewhat nasty workaround for a nasty DB, but it seems to work.
