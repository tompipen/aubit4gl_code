I wanted this to go in the Informix Archive because a lot of work went
into making this code work with Informix. In some cases it was improved
over what was originally posted on purdue.edu.

This posting in the archive of Tcl stuff was not meant to be a "compile
and go" for anybody you wanted to use it. We don't have the time or
desire to do that. This stuff has been tested in a complicated production
environment and it works for us. You should get the Tcl Informix
code from purdue.edu and look at it.

The "Makefile" is custom to our installation. Trying to include all of
it so it will work on your system is too much work. If you are interested
enough to be using Informix/TcL interface then should have no trouble
figuring out how to compile this stuff.

How we used it. . .

We used Tcl/Informix in the following way:

We needed to do statistical calculations envolving blood typing/DNA analysis
for establishing paternity. The method of doing this required a lot of
list comparison. From the Informix database we created temporary tables
that had sets of data that the calculation would work on.

The Tcl code did the calculation work by reading data from the temp tables
and putting data back into temp tables. 

This was done in 4GL by creating a Tcl Interpreter and calling it
with the filename of the Tcl code. Since Tcl was linked with esql/c
and because it is part of the same process you get an "imbeddable language"
into 4GL that works just the way Tcl was intended.
