This library enables automatic entry of Mantis issues into a mantis bug tracking database

You must enable the error hook processing using either an OPTIONS statement within the 4GL program
or by setting



eg. 
	main
	options errorhook "errhook_mantis"
	...
	end main

or

	$ export A4GL_CALLERRHOOK=errhook_mantis




You *must* set MANTIS_USERNAME, MANTIS_PASSWORD and MANTIS_PROJECT to use this library.
These are the usernames/passwords for your mantis account - *not* your unix account!

The MANTIS_PROJECT should be the project ID for the project you wish to log the entries into.

You can get the projectID by doing a 'view source' in firefox on your mantis page and reviewing the 
option values in the project ID dropdown..

You must specify the project number - a project name will * not work *
