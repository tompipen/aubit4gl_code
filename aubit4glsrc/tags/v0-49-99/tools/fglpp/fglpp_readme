Initial release: Apr 96
Current release: Oct 97

Usage:

nawk -f fglpp input.4gl tempglobals output.4gl [ search_dirs... ]

where	input.4gl	is the file to be preprocessed
	tempglobals	is the temporary globals file referenced by output.4gl
	output.4gl	is the preprocessed file to be passed to c4gl or fglpc
	search_dirs	is a list of directories where #include or globals
			files can be found

Directives:

#define name token_string
#include "filename"

Notes:

Fglpp was written mostly because existing 4gl preprocessing tools (m4gl and
ppcc4gl) do not apply (or allow, for that matter) #define directives within
globals files referenced by the files to be preprocessed

By contrast, with fglpp is possible to use code like the following:

sample.4gl:					|	globals.4gl:
~~~~~~~~~~~					|	~~~~~~~~~~~
...							|	...
#define arraysize 10		|	globals
							|	    define
globals "globals.4gl"		|		my_array array[arraysize] of ...
							|	...
for i=1 to arraysize		|	end globals
...							|
end for						|

or:

sample.4gl:					|	globals.4gl:
~~~~~~~~~~~					|	~~~~~~~~~~~
...							|	#define arraysize 10
globals "globals.4gl"		|	globals
							|	    define
for i=1 to arraysize		|		my_array array[arraysize] of ...
...							|	...
end for						|	end globals

or even:

sample.4gl:					|	globals.4gl:
~~~~~~~~~~~					|	~~~~~~~~~~~
...							|	...
#include "projectdefs"		|	globals
							|	    define
globals "globals.4gl"		|		my_array array[arraysize] of ...
							|	...
for i=1 to arraysize		|	end globals
...							|
end for						|

and have arraysize defined in projectdefs.
Note that the first or third example give you the possibility to have different
arraysize for different applications (and you could even use, in different
applications, different types for the same globals variable)

Unlike ppcc4gl, fglpp tries to preserve the line count of the file to be
preprocessed. It does this by not writing the the ouput file #define
directives or comments found in #include files, so if you refrain
from #including code, the line count of the output file will match
that of the input file.

M4gl achieves the same result by discarding anything but define directives
from included files. This altogether precludes the possibility of including
code in the source file, unless you hack with m4 directives on your own.
Also, m4gl does not permit to define something within the input file itself
(of course, it's pretty easy to extend m4gl with such a capability).

On the other hand, fglpp lacks all the beautiful features of cpp and m4.

#define & #include directives may appear anywhere in the input or globals files.
#include directives can be freely nested.
Globals and #include files can be placed, besides than in the current
directory, in any of the directories  specified in the command line.

Note that globals and end globals statements should appear in globals files
only, and not in #include files referenced by the former.
If you do differently, fglpp will try to make sense of your code, but it's
not guaranteed to succeed.

Lastly, as a bonus, fglpp will simulate support for multiple globals files,
if your 4gl release does not support them.

Restrictions:

To partly address speed issues, fglpp currently uses pattern matching for 
#define substitutions. This, while being as much as 3 times faster than
proper substitution (i.e. match & substr operations), is not completely
secure, and could lead to the wrong token being substituted for poorly
named #defines. This *usually* leads to compile-time errors, so fear not
incomprehensible run time behaviour (that is, if you refrain from naming a
definition like a substring of another).
To be on the safe side I use unique definition prefixes (T_ for types,
K_ for constants, etc).
The general rule is not to use definition names that are substrings of
other tokens.
