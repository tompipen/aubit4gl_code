This uses libsmtp (http://libsmtp.berlios.de) - which in turn required GLIB..


There are some patches on belios for this - which may be needed :

	Some mail servers need to recognize the boundary end for ending the attachment. 
	Otherwise the attachment may be truncated. This libsmtp_part_end() is called after the last libsmtp_part_send() 
	call and before the libsmtp_body_end() call for sending a boundary end line.
