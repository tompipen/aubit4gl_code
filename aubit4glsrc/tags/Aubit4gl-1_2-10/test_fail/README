This is a directory where test failures will be logged...

If you run the tests with :

 	run_tests ... -log-unl -log-text="NODB" ...

You should get error files/error messages logged here in the "NODB" directory etc...


*** DO NOT ADD/COMMIT THE .ERR FILES BACK INTO CVS !!! ***

You should probably just ignore it...
