Potential issues:

1. Brinkmanship in the dimensions of help.per 
2. End of line (CR+LF) problems on MS systems?
3. Function name clashes (look at the ones with names myxxxxx()
4. The 3 files: amkmessage.c, unmkmessage.c, help.4gl have to stay in sync
5. Using MSByte in offset (multiplied by 16777216) may be de trop.
6. No attempt to split long error messages over 1 or more lines (most Unix
   error messages are very short and succinct)
