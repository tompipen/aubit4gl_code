I have lots of "web stuff" running that use these functions.  I can't tell
you how happy I was to find the original version of this.  Now that I
"fixed" it, it has become indespensible, and enabled me to do lots of web
programmin that previously was very kludgey (We use informix 2.x and 4.1
...  Informix's webdriver cgi is not available for us, and none of the Perl
Interfaces work either).  This code was a godsend.
