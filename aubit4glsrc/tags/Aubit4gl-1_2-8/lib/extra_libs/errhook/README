This is a sample error hook function

The function takes 4 parameters 
	Line 
	Module
	Error  # 
	ErrorMessage


Usage
-----

You need to set the environment variable CALLERRHOOK to be the name of the library that holds a function called 'errlog'.
That function is called when a program dies because of an error (it isn't called for a core dump, or an EXIT PROGRAM etc)

eg: 
	
    cd lib/extra_libs/errhook
    make
    export CALLERRHOOK=errhook_sample

(you dont need the 'lib' or the '.so')
