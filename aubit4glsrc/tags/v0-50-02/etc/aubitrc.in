# To change this file, it is recomended to use "configurator" program. This
# program also provides detailed description of each option.
#
# Descriptions found in this file are for convenience only, are no longer

# To get information about current settings that apply, use "aubit-config" program

# 			Aubit 4gl configuration file.
#
#   When this file have file name "aubitrc.in" - it's intendend for use
#   with "configure" script, as input file for creation of "aubitrc".
#   When this file have file name "aubitrc" - it's a configration file,
#   and you are free to edit it as you wish.
#
#   Read by:
#			all Aubit compilers (4glc,fcomile...) and compiler script (4glpc)
#           All Aubit compiler make files (via incl/Makefile-common include)
#           All Aubit compiled 4gl programs
#
#   Read from, in this order:
#			1: /etc/opt/aubit4gl/aubitrc
#			2: $AUBITDIR/etc/aubitrc
#			3: ~/.aubit4gl/aubitrc  (`=$HOME=user's home directory)
#			4: ./.aubitrc (current directory)
#			5: $A4GL_INIFILE environment variable
#
#   Note: Defaults are in (), dependencies in []
#
# You can override any and all settings defaults as defined in Aubit compilers,
# not just ones listed in this file. See output of "aubit-config -a" for list
# of all defaults and there values.
#
# Note that some settings names like A4GL_DBPATH, are cumulated from all
# available sources (Environment, Windows registry, aubitrc file(s)) and all
# allow for both Aubit specific version of the name ("A4GL_DBPATH") and the
# generic name like "DBPATH" to allow for compatibility with third-party product
# that also use them. Aubit specific ones have priority in the non-cumulative,
# cases and when setting can be cumulated, Aubit specific ones will appear
# first in cumulated string.
#
# Because this file is used from different tools (make,sh,programs) it is
# important to use syntax that can be provessed by all. This means:
#
#  * Use only # character as the first character in line as comment
#  * Do not leave any space between variable name and equal (=) sign
#  * Do not leave any spave between equal sign (=) and value
#  * Do not enclose value for variables needed by Make in quotes, because
#   	Make will take them litteraly
#  * Do not leave spaecs in value without enclosing them in quotes, because
#       this would cause shell scripts to report error

#You can select which packer to use by setting the variable "A4GL_PACKER"

# This will probably give the smalled output files
# 2) XDR
#  This is the same as doing it the old way
# 3) XML
#  This stores and reads the data in an XML file. The reading is very limited
# and can basically only read the XML files that it generates - IT IS NOT A
# FULL BLOWN XML PARSER. It uses some odd constructs and isn't ideal - but
# you'll get the idea when you see the output. Size of created files is
# much larger then PACKED or XDR
# 4) PERL
# This generates a data structure which can be used inside a perl program - its
# pretty complicated stuff though using hashes for the data representation.
