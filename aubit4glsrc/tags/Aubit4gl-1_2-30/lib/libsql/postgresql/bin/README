You need the sys views created by the pg8.sql in the parent directory : 

create view syscolumns as 
select attrelid as tabid,
       attname as colname,
       attnum as colno,
       atttypid as coltype,
       attlen as collength
from pg_attribute;
create view systables as 
select oid as tabid,
       0 as nrows,
      'T'::char(1) as tabtype,
      relnatts as ncols,
      relname as tabname
from pg_class where relhasoids='t' ;
create view sysindexes as 
select oid as tabid,
       0 as nrows,
      'I'::char(1) as idxtype,
      relnatts as ncols,
      relname as idxname
from pg_class where relhasoids!='t' ;
create view sysusers as
select usename as username,
       'D'::char(1) as usertype,
       9::smallint as priority,
       passwd as password
from pg_user;
