This library was designed to provide an interface between INFORMIX-4gl and Tcl.
It basically provides a subset of the functionality that C has to Tcl.

The functions from C/Tcl are:
   Tcl_CreateInterp
   Tcl_DeleteInterp
   Tcl_Eval
   Tcl_EvalFile
   Tcl_GlobalEval
   Tcl_Startup

These are described on Section 28.2, page 264 of ``An Introduction to Tcl and
Tk'' (draft of 16 April 1993) by John K. Ousterhout.  Except for Tcl_Startup,
which is an extended tcl command.

The 4gl function provided are as follows:
   define
      tclInterpID int,
      fileName    char(256),   # string can be shorter but not longer
      script      char(512),   # string can be shorter but not longer
      tclCode     int,
      tclResult   char(???)    # there is no set length of this string

Tcl4gl_CreateInterp() returning tclInterpID
     creates an interpreter that will be referenced by tclInterpID

Tcl4gl_DeleteInterp(tclInterpID)
     deletes the interpreter tclInterpID

Tcl4gl_Eval(tclInterpID, script) returning tclCode, tclResult
     evaluates script inside the interpreter referenced by tclInterpID
     returns the tclCode (0 iff. successful, similar to sqlca.sqlcode),
     and the string result of the interpreter

Tcl4gl_EvalFile(tclInterpID, fileName) returning tclCode, tclResult
     evaluates the file, fileName, inside interpreter ref'ed by tclInterpID.
     returns the tclCode (0 iff. successful, similar to sqlca.sqlcode),
     and the string result of the interpreter

Tcl4gl_GlobalEval(tclInterpID, script) returing tclCode, tclResult
     same as Tcl4gl_Eval but evaluates at a global level 
       instead of current local level.

Tcl4gl_Startup(tclInterpID, arg0, arg1, arg2, arg3, ..., argN)
     this is an extended Tcl function.  It creates an interactive interpreter
     (command loop) right in the middle of your 4gl program.  This is intended
     for use when debugging.
