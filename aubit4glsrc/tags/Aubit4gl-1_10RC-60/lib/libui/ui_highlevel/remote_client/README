This directory contains functions/routines which will
enable the HL_... code to be split across machines in 
order to create a thin client..



	***  This is a work in progress! ***



The makefile will create several outputs :


	libLL_server.so - A convinience library for wrapping common server stuff up
	libUI_client.so - This is a UI you can use just like TUI, HL_TUI, HL_GTK etc.. A4GL_UI=client

	server_gtk	- This is the thin client program for displaying the output (GTK mode)
	server_tui	- This is the thin client program for displaying the output (TUI mode)
	server_console  - Not yet - but soon...

The remoting is done via RPC calls for now,although this is easy enough to change - because the interface
is defined by the .spec file..
(In this way - it should be possible to adapt this technology to abstract many of the Aubit4GL interfaces which use a spec file)


Todo list :
	fix some of the @todo's
	remove the need for libaubit4gl from the lowlevel code 
	add a facility for setting/retrieving the status properly..
	Allow the target to be selected (see clnt_main.c - it just calls localhost..)
