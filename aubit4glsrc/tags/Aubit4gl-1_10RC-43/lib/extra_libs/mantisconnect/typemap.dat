# This file contains custom definitions of the XML Schema types and
# C/C++ types for your project, and XML namespace prefix definitions.
# The wsdl2h WSDL importer consults this file to determine bindings.

// This comment will be included in the generated .h file

# XML namespace prefix definitions can be provided to override the
# default choice of ns1, ns2, ... prefixes. For example:

i = "http://www.soapinterop.org/"
s = "http://www.soapinterop.org/xsd"

# Type definitions are of the form: # type = declaration | use | pointer-use
# where
# type is the XML Schema type (or an application type in a namespace
# that has a prefix definition given as above).
# declaration is an optional C/C++ type declaration
# use is how the type is referred to in code
# pointer-use is how the type should be referred to as a pointer (opt)
# Example XML Schema and C/C++ type bindings:

xsd__int = | int
xsd__string = | char* | char*
# You can extend structs and classes with member data and functions.
# For example, adding a constructor to ns__myClass: ns__myClass = $ ns__myClass();
# The general form is # class_name = $ member;
