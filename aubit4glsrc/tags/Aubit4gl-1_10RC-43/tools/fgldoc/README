Introduction
============

This is version 2.00 of fgldoc, a documenter for Informix-4GL programs.
See the "Installation" section of this file for building and installation
instructions.  The program is documented in the manual page "fgldoc.1"; a
preformatted version is included as "fgldoc.txt".


Requirements
============

1. An ANSI C compiler.

2. ESQL/C or Informix-4GL (C compiled, not RDS), if you want the ability to
   access the program design database directly.  Any version from 4.00
   onwards should work.  Be warned that connections are implicit and use
   your current credentials; CONNECT TO... USER... USING is not implemented.

Point #2 implies having proper development and run-time licenses for the
machine(s) where you build and run fgldoc.  The term "proper" doesn't even
begin to describe all the variations and nuances that could exist; for a
reasonably detailed (and certainly more authoritative) discussion of the
matter, consult the file "Informix.License" from the DBD::Informix
distribution, available at any CPAN site (a Perl module repository, start
from http://www.perl.org if you don't know how to find one).  That said, in
the anticipated case of running fgldoc on the same machine where it was
compiled it is probably OK to use the locally installed ESQL/C software
for building the program.


Installation
============

If you have a working ESQL/C or Informix-4GL setup and want to use it with
fgldoc, make sure that INFORMIXDIR is set and $INFORMIXDIR/bin is in $PATH,
and start the "configure" script with

    ./configure

The script will make a number of checks and, if all is well, generate
"Makefile" and "config.h".  To build fgldoc, type "make"; after that, type
"make install" to install the program and the manual page, or copy them to
a suitable directory by hand.

Those who don't have ESQL/C or do not wish to use it should specify the
"--without-esqlc" argument with "configure", like so:

    ./configure --without-esqlc

Building and installation steps are the same.

N.B. If the INFORMIXC environment variable is set, the "configure" script
and the Makefile will NOT pass the value of CFLAGS to esql.
