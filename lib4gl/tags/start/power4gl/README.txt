                Readme for Power-4gl function library
                -------------------------------------

Power-4gl is a tool-kit which greatly enhances the x-4gl programming
environment by adding a robust family of general purpose functions. In
particular, the package enables easy production of friendly and
sophisticated user interface objects and reports.

Power-4gl was initially written by John H. Frantz, and donated to Aubit
4gl project, where it is extended, and maintained as part of Aubit 4gl
OpenSource development process.  By preserving compatibility with other
x4gl language compilers, intention is for Power-4GL to become standard 4gl
functions library for all users of x4gl compatible compilers.
