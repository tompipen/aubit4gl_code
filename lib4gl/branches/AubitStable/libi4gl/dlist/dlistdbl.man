.SH DESCRIPTION
There are 9 routines in this package which provide a fairly
complete service for handling doubly-linked lists (Dlists)
of the I4GL \s-2FLOAT\s0 or \s-2SMALLFLOAT\s0 data types.
Lists are created (\fBsc_mkdbl\fP) and destroyed (\fBsc_rmdbl\fP).
Items can be inserted (\fBsc_insdbl\fP), deleted (\fBsc_deldbl\fP)
and changed (\fBsc_upddbl\fP).
Items can be retrieved by position in the list (\fBsc_getdbl\fP),
and the size of the list can be determined by \fBsc_cntdbl\fP, and
the current position discovered by \fBsc_numdbl\fP.
Each list has a current position recorded (provided there are any
items in the list).
The routines are described in the sections below.
.SH SC_MKDBL
This routine either returns the index number of a new Dlist (Dlist#)
or a negative number indicating an error.
This routine must be called before any of the other routines are used.
.SH SC_RMDBL
This routine is given a Dlist# and deletes all the records in the
list and then removes the list.
Further calls using this Dlist# will fail with EINVARG.
The Dlist# may be re-used by the Dlist package after another call
to \fBsc_mkdbl\fP.
.SH SC_INSDBL
This routine is given two arguments, a Dlist# and an float value.
The value will be inserted into the list after the current position,
and becomes the current item.
.SH SC_DELDBL
This routine is given a Dlist# and deletes the current item.
.SH SC_UPDDBL
This routine expects a Dlist# and an float value.
The current item is deleted and the value passed is inserted in
its place.
.SH SC_ZAPDBL
This routine is given a Dlist# and deletes all the items in the
list; the list remains active but is empty.
.SH SC_GETDBL
This routine is given three arguments; the Dlist#, a flag
indicating the action and an offset qualifying the action.
The flag may take any of the following values:
.sp
`F' \(em relative position
.br
`L' \(em last position
.br
`N' \(em next position
.br
`P' \(em previous position
.br
`C' \(em current position
.br
`A' \(em absolute position
.br
`R' \(em relative position
.sp
The first, last and current options ignore the offset.
The relative option takes a signed offset and moves forward (if
positive) or backward (if negative) through the list.
A zero offset fetches the current item.
The other options expect a positive offset.
The next option moves forward by the relevant number of steps,
the previous option moves back;
if the offset is zero, the move is by one item.
The absolute option moves from the start of the list to the
specified offset.
If this offset is zero, no row is returned (it returns a null
value), but no error is indicated either.
This behaviour is useful when repositioning the current item
after inserting some data into what was an empty list.
If the offset would go beyond the end of the list (either
forwards or backwards), the first or last item is fetched as
appropriate; no error is signalled unless the list is empty.
.P
The routine returns the error status and the value from the list.
If there is an error status returned, the contents of the value
variable is indeterminate.
.SH SC_CNTDBL
This routine expects a Dlist# and returns the number of items on
the Dlist.
.SH SC_NUMDBL
This routine expects a Dlist# and returns the number of the
current item in the list.
.SH "ERROR RETURN VALUES"
The error values returned are:
.sp
\00 \(em ENOERROR no error
.br
\-1 \(em ENOLIST no items in the list
.br
\-2 \(em EINVARG invalid argument
.br
\-3 \(em ENOMEM no more memory
.SH FILES
dlist.h \(em interfaces and constants
.br
dlistdbl.c \(em code
.br
dltstdbl.4gl \(em a verification test program
.sp
This code is purely interface code and uses the routine provided
by the Dlist package (DLIST(3S)) to actually store the data.
.SH BUGS
None known.
.SH DEFICIENCIES
There is no mechanism for searching by value rather than by
position in list.
