.TH SCREEN_DUMP 3I "Sphinx Informix Tools"
.SH NAME
screen_dump \(em dump the screen to a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ft B
function screen_dump(filename)
.br
define filename char(256)
.ft R
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function dumps the contents of the screen (as I4GL thinks
the screen looks like) to the file named by the argument.
.SH WARNINGS
This function uses the support function \fIpopstring\fP;
this must be available in the library where \fIscreen_dump\fP lives.
.P
This code was designed and tested on an AT&T 3B2/400 running 
UNIX System V Release 3.0 using Informix 4GL version 1.10.00C.
It is not guaranteed to work even in this environment, though
testing indicates that it does work both here and on a Compaq 386
running Xenix/386 version 2.2.2.
.SH BUGS
If some other program has scribbled on the screen, the other
scibbling is not shown in the screen dump.
.P
This program actually dumps the \fIcurses\fP screen \fIstdscr\fP.
It is assumed that this is fully refreshed when the routine is
called, and the screen seems to be fully refreshed in normal use.
