.TH FILEEXTN 3S "Sphinx Internal System"
.SH NAME
fileextn \(em find extension of file name
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBfileextn\fP(s)
 define
  s char(14)
 ...
 return s
.br
end function
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBFileextn\fP returns the extension of the filename supplied as its argument.
The extension must be less than half the length of the string.
This means that `a.out' does not have an extension.
.SH BUGS
It is not clear that the heuristic is the best, but it works except 
with oddball cases.
