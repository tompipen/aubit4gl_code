<h3 align="center">Jonathan Leffler's function library</h3>
<hr>
<p>Here is a whole bunch of library code, some in C, some in I4GL, to do various
nasty tricky things -- and not so tricky but just downright fiddly things -- in
I4GL. Most of the code is pretty ancient.</p>
<p>Any .4gf files can be renamed to end .per -- I used to use .4gf to
distinguish I4GL form files from ISQL form files. The dlist4 directory is of
debatable value -- I still use the plain dlist (dlist version 3) material. It is
used for doubly-linked lists, which I use in preference to scroll cursors.</p>
<p>The C code tends to make extensive use of popstring() which strips trailing
blanks; it is built into I4GL in more recent versions. The adjinarr code is
probably too sneaky for practical use, especially since I4GL 7.30 provides the
functionality.</p>
<p>The nextfield code is also very sneaky but provides very necessary
functionality in my view -- but I last changed it in 1988 because it was not
easy to justify cheating so much.</p>
<p>The pushhelp code is also rather sneaky, and the benefit it provides is
limited (but not invaluable). I eventually decided that a pure I4GL
implementation was better than a sneaky version -- where I used it, the pure
I4GL version was adequate.</p>
<p>The locale code is interesting, and maybe even better than what GLS provides
in some respects - such as a single run of the program can format data using
multiple different locales. It is based on material from Plauger's &quot;The
Standard C Library&quot; and so you need to think carefully before using it.</p>
<p>I make no great claims for any of this material -- it was used in the
1987-1990 time frame, but that's about all. And there are manual pages of some
sort, written using troff formatting...</p>
