4gwMail 1.2 release notes				Mar, 20 2000

1) Introduction
4gwMail is a 4glWorks based mail and news reader which can be quickly fitted
in existing application. Making use of standard mail & news locking schemes and
file formats, it is compatible with most mailers in circulation, thus allowing
users to manage messages folders and newsgroups both from within their custom
business application and using their favourite mailer.

2) Features
- message center
- dual pane operation: main pane shows header info, slave message body
- message sorting: by author, date, subject and thread, both ascending and
  descending
- selectable header display detail
- supports multiple folders
- supports timely new mail checks
- message ops: print, save to file, copy to folder, move to folder, delete,
  reply (quoted or bracketed), forward (quoted or bracketed), edit & resend,
  cancel
- supported composer headers: to:, cc:, newsgroups:, followup-to:, expires:
- folder ops: create and delete
- newsgroup ops: subscribe and unsubscribe
- preferences editor
- system wide settings in /usr/local/etc/4gwmailrc, local in ~/.4gwmailrc
- various customizable texts (requires editing of appropriate text files)
- demo applications wrapper in 4gwapps/maildemo: demonstrates 4gwMail
  capabilities, offers guildelines on how to embed 4gwMail into applications

3) Limitations
A list of items that have not been included in 4gwMail can be found in
4gwmods/mail/etc/todo. The most prominent limitations are the lack of a decent
text editor (which descends straight from 4gl), and the fact that 4gwMail does
not keep track of message status: newsgroup access implies download of all
article headers, and folder access implies integral folder reload, even if
already accessed within the same session. 
In short, though 4gwMail has been succesfully used against large folders (up to
one thousend messages) and over slow links, it is better suited for small
folders (up to a hundred messages) and fast NNTP server connections.

As of this writing, 4gwMail does not support TLI connections.

4) Compilation
4gwmail comes with an autoconf generated configure script which is executed
automatically by the installation script, so it should compile out of the box.
A few hint follow, should you run into problems.

4.1) Configure output files
There are 4 files you should create: 4gwmods/mail/buldfile and
4gwmods/mail/source/{gd,id,is}-osdep.h.
The first is simply a makefile style include file containing a list of socket
related libraries that should be used for linking, all the others are header
files required for the datetime parser, directory and socket routines.
Start of by creating each file copying it from the corresponding template
(find it in the same directory, with a .in postfixed the appropriate filename).
Edit buildfile to include the libraries (if any is needed) containig all the
socket related routines. The header files will contain #undef directives of
the form HAVE_<some characteristic>, each complete with a short description.
For each of the header files or types or structs described present in your
system, change the corresponding #undef into #define.

4.2) Datetime routines
HPUX users, please note that yacc output needs to be passed thru an ansi
compiler. Set INFORMIXC to cc -Ae before firing cbuild or mkfgwgo.

4.3) Error messages
Several error codes are OS dependent. Depending on the OS in use, messages
of the form "seddd?!" could be displayed rather than meaningfull text.
In this event, ddd is a 3 digit error code returned by the failing system
call. Meaningfull messages can be obtained by looking up the error number
meaning in /usr/include/sys/errno.h, and adding an appropriate message
in 4gwmods/mail/<lan>/imil.txt.

5) Integration into 4glworks applications
This is slightly more complicated than for "normal" 4glworks modules.
You should change your buildfile to include 4gwmods/mail/buildfile
and add a $(LIBS) dependency to any target that includes 4gwMail.
An example of a linking script can be found in 4gwapps/maildemo/buildfile

6) Dual pane scroller
The heart of 4gwMail, the mail viewer, has been written over a general purpose
dual pane scroller, which can be easily used for display of other types of data.
Find the source in 4gwmods/mail/source/{idpns.4gl,idpng.4gl}, the documentation
in 4gwmods/mail/etc/idpns.html.

7) Acknowledgements
The string to datetime routines used within this package were kindly
provided by Art S. Kagel <kagel@bloomberg.net>. I merely added the 4gl
interface. The routines are in the public domain, and I make no claim
on my own additions.
