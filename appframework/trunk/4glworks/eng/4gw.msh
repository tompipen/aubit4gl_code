o    hit "Y" (to give an affermative answer) or "N" (to give a 
     negative one), or

                        Printers

Chances are that you need to enable an inactive printer.
Just indicate the printer you wish to reenable (<Ctrl-B> for a list of 
available printers) and hit <ESC> or <CR>. The application will test
the printer status and warn you about any problem by asking

 Printer disabled: enable it now? (y/n)

You now have to check the printer (paper in bin? is it online? a paper
jam somewhere?) and hit "Y" to signify that the printer is working and
should be enabled, or "N" if you no longer want to loose time with it. 
Hit <DEL>, and you're back to whatever you were doing.
.32
			 Reports

You are ready to fire a report but alas the application is asking you which
printer to use, which form, and how many copies.

There are two possibilities:

1) If you see no error message, the application is just built to ask you
to review and confirm printing parameters

2) If you see an error message, then

- the application doesn't know where to send the report, or
- the printer chosen does not exist, or
- the printer does not accept requests, or
- the form chosen is not appropriate for the report to be fired 

Just choose an alternative printer or form and inform the system
administrator of any serious printer problem.

If you hit <DEL> no report will take place.
.33
                         Reports

After firing a report, the application checks if the printer needs
operator intervention (is it turned on? out of paper? off line? etc)
If this is the case, the application displays

 Continue? (y/n)
 Check printer <printer name>

You have the option of checking the printer and hitting "Y" to signal
that the printer should be enabled.
Should the printer still have problems, above question will be reiterated
until you either give up by hitting "N" or <DEL> or you actually resolve
the problem which got the printer disabled.
Should you hit "N", please remember that your report has been queued, and 
sooner or later (when you or somebody else manages to renable the printer!)
it will be printed, so please don't run your report again, as this
will only prolong the print queue.
