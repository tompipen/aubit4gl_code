4gwMail demo 1.2 release notes					May 23, 1999

Well, I'm afraid you won't find much info here. The application is simple
enough that it can be learned just by browsing the menus, but if you really
insist in having a couple of hints, here they are:

"Messages" lets you access all the message related commands (reply, forward,
print, copy, move, etc...). In case you're wondering, eXport and Save both
write a message to a file, the only difference being in the amount of headers
written to it.

"Folders" is the way to go for the folder related ops (create, drop, newsgroup
[un]subscription, folder selection, etc...)

"View" lets you display (& set) preferences, and switch between message center
and folder display.

Message composition is straight fordward - the only thing worth noting is
that you do not need to enter a complete RFC822 date in the expires: field -
the application will try to figure one out of what you write. It catches
almost anything, try it out! 

Application-wide preferences are stored in $DBPATH/4gwmail.rc, user
preferences in $HOME/.4gwmailrc. These are just about the only two compiled
in strings. All others can be made to suit your tastes by appropriately
changing the .txt files in $DBPATH/maildemo

And Oh, yes! you quit the damn thing with Ctrl-X.

Have fun,
Marco Greco <marco@4glworks.com>
