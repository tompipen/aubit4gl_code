Ventas Desktop Client README

Linux:
You can use the VDC.sh script to start the Client or you have to set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the path where you extract the VDC. You can set
it in your .bashrc in your home directory. 
For example:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/home/ventas/VDC/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
