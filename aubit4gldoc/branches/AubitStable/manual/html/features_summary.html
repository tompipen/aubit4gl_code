<p align="left"><u><i>It is an GNU, GPL, OpenSource project</i></u></p>
<p align="left">Yes, it will cost you nothing, but there are much more important
implications that this, in out view. It's feature does not depend on anyone but
you. To find out more about implications of this feature, please see <a href="http://www.opensource.org">www.opensource.org</a>
and <a href="http://www.gnu.org">www.gnu.org</a> .</p>
<p align="left"><i><u>It has commercial support provider</u></i></p>
<p align="left">Available as option, this will guaranty you can use Aubit 4gl in
business-critical situations with confidence, and bring together best from both
worlds. To learn more, please visit <a href="http://www.aubit.com">www.aubit.com</a>
.</p>
<p align="left"><u><i>Based on robust, mature, stabile, efficient and productive
language</i></u></p>
<p align="left">x4GL is dedicated to writing business related, database oriented
applications, and this is what it does, in our opinion, best in the world. It is
easy to learn, implement, and maintain.&nbsp;And most of all, it is at least 3
times more productive in all aspect of software lifecycle compared to third
generation languages like C, and at least two times compared to best component
development environments.</p>
<p align="left"><i><u>It's FAST!</u></i></p>
<p align="left">Full n tire deployment, native C code generation compiled by optimized
C compilers bring together advantages of high, human-like development language,
and low, machine-level runtime execution performance. Not to mention you can
interpolate C code directly in 4gl code!</p>
<p align="left"><i><u>It's compatible with number of commercial products</u></i></p>
<p align="left">Giving you the option to mix and match features and environments
based on particular situation. You will never again be locked in one compiler,
one company or one database. You can develop wit commercial product, deploy with
a4gl and save on runtime licensing, at the same time gaining the speed of C
compiled runtime. Or you can use 4gl Wizard functionality and templates in
development, and deploy using commercial runtime that supports client side
functionality that is not present in Aubit 4gl at the moment</p>
<p align="left"><u><i>Database, OS and platform and user interface independent</i></u></p>
<p align="left">ODBC means choosing database is no longer the issue. And you can
develop and deploy wherever GCC compiler is available with single recompile. And
because of full n-tire support, you can use CUI, GUI and Web interfaces from
same code, and same compiled program, at the same time.</p>
<p align="left"><u><i>It already has big developers base, and big existing
applications base</i></u></p>
<p align="left">This is not a new language, just a new implementation of mature
and successful language. So you will not need to look hard to find developers
for your projects. And since 4gl is English-like in syntax, programmers with experience
in any language will be productive in just few days. On top of that, you will
not need to look far to find commercial, tried and tested applications in any field
of business oriented database applications.</p>

<p align="left"><font size="6"><a name="Extended syntax and functionality benefits">Extended syntax and functionality benefits</a></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Associative Arrays<br>
    This productivity enhancement will make complex Array manipulations easy and
    fast, and at the same time make your code easier to maintain and understand</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">PAUSE
Screen Handling<br>
    Will enhance usability over the slower connection lines, no matter what
    front-end implementation you will deploy</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">ODBC Compliance<br>
    Is the crucial feature for unprecedented connectivity and freedom of
    database options in 4GL world</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Multiple concurrent connections<br>
    Based on ODBC access concept, this feature will enable you to not only
    easily open several databases at the same time, and keep them open, but also
    to open several databases from several vendors from different servers,
    bringing together all database resources in corporate environments</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Application Constants<br>
    Small but effective contribution to error free programs that are easier to maintain
    and debug</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Map Files<br>
    will for the firs time enable you to have full overview of what is your code
    doing, how, and where. Indispensable for debugging and understanding of
    unfamiliar code, and behavior of compiler.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Variable IDs<br>
    No more hard-coded ID names! You can specify and reference all 4GL objects
    in the runtime! No more copy-and-paste code just to change ID names,
    resulting in higher productivity and code that is compact and easier to
    maintain.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">
Passing IDs to functions<br>
    One of the implications of Variable IDs, it will allow you to name objects
    passed to functions, even in another module.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Embedded 'C' code.<br>
    No mere messing around external C code, and no more complex make and link
    process. Just embed your C code with your 4gl code, in the same source code
    file.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Move/Show/Hide Window<br>
    Enhanced windows manipulation resulting in more usable and flexible user
    interfaces.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">WHENEVER SUCCESS/SQLSUCCESS<br>
    Will give you new options for conditional code execution, instead of always
    depending on error conditions.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Multi-level Menus<br>
    User interface enhancement that will at the same time make the coding and
    ussing application faster and easier.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">
Extended Display Array Control<br>
    Providing many of features of INPUT ARRAY, and dynamically setting current
    and display lines of array, it will eliminate need to use INPUT ARRAY logic
    where input is not needed, making the result safer and code cleaner and
    easier to maintain.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">
Extended &quot;USING&quot; syntax<br>
Provides more options for commonly used date formatting in reports an on the
display, without the need to write additional code to handle this formatting,
making especially report writing more productive.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">
Local functions<br>
    Defining a function to be local to the module opens possibilities fore some
    interesting and productive program structuring, and can also contribute to
    more easily maintainable and problem-free code.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">get_info function<br>
    Will enable you to get almost all of the information about the state ofthe
    running program in the runtime. It will allow you to write code flexible
    like never before, and achieve tasks that where simply not possible with
    other x4gl compilers.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Dynamic Screen Fields<br>
    allows input field to accept more data than it will fit in screen field
    size, making for more usable and flexible user interfaces.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Remote Function Calls<br>
    Will make x4gl applications for the first time enter the n-tire world.
    Running programs on same or different machine, or even platform, and call
    each other and execute function and return results. This can not only
    enhance typical 3-tire role separation, but also facilitate multi-processing
    on the level of the application, application partitioning on protocol level
    and enable wired things like accessing UNIX database from Windows PC that
    have no ODBC drivers for specific platform....</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">
SELECT/DELETE/UPDATE USING<br>
    by linking a record with a table and it's primary key, this extreme
    productive enhancement will automate and simplify multi-table data
    manipulation to the extreme, the way it was always supposed to be, gaining
    productivity and maintainability in the ways you did not experience before.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">ON ANY KEY<br>
    extremely useful with array manipulation, it will simplify user interaction
    logic in many places.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Compile Time Environment Setting<br>
    Ability to override many library setting in the compile time will enable you
    to control compilers behavior in ways not imaginable with other x4gl
    compilers</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">SET SESSION OPTION/SET CURSOR OPTION<br>
    Thanks to the ODBC connectivity, it is possible to assign and change all
    attributes of database connection and defined database cursor at runtime,
    resulting in adjustable connection attributes at the same time exploring all
    the power of target ODBC driver and database from simple a4gl statement.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Application Partitioning<br>
    Thanks to user interface layer on one side, and ODBC layer on the other, and
    combined with RPC calling functionality, it is now possible to fully utilize
    all the resources of the enterprise environment, end-to-end, and deploy a4gl
    programs from one single computer, to hundreds of connected computers
    running different or same layers.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Y2K runtime translation<br>
    Two digit year support is implemented using run-time environment variable
    setting, enabling you to dynamically decide interpretation of year while
    preserving the code that was not written using 4 digit year functionality.
    Aubit 4gl is, of course, full Y2K compliant.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">
Globbing<br>
    You can freely mix and use all IDs as module specific or global, allowing
    you do make distinction when naming ID's at runtime, thanks to 'Variable
    ID's' and the ability to pass ID's to functions as parameters. This
    functionality alone can save significant time in the coding process, and
    enhance the ability to isolate ID related problems extremely easy.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">A4GL Wizard and program templates<br>
    Will allow the generation of full 4gl code for typical table oriented
    screens, just by specifying and compiling the template with few simple
    definition, much in the way that users used to use Informix ISQL tool, but
    with full code generation and unprecedented flexibility, even to the point
    of direct inclusion in other 4gl programs.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">PDF report generation<br>
    Built using PDFlib, blah blah, FIXME: add PDF syntax to &quot;A4GL enhancements
    page&quot;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Graphical User Interface (GUI)<br>
    Built using GTK+, blah blah, FIXME: add GUI syntax to &quot;A4GL enhancements
    page&quot;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Interactive Development Environment (IDE)<br>
    Written completely using 4gl, this application facilitates rapid development
    of any x4gl language application, while thanks to available source code
    remaining fully customizable using tools and language familiar to any 4gl
    language developer. FIXME: add JL's instructions to &quot;Development
    Environment&quot; page</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Please see appropriate sections of &quot;A4GL enhancements to
standard x4GL language for details of all features and syntax.</p>
