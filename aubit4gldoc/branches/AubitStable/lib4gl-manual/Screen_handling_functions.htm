<H1>Screen handling functions</H1>
<P>These are some of the more essential functions in Power-4gl that handle 
various screen operations.</P>
<H3><A name=Helpman>Helpman</A></H3>
<P>Opens and handles a scrollable help window. This function can be called from 
any Power-4gl user interface window with the "help" logical key. The help text 
to be browsed is a concatenation of 3 flat text files, the first two being 
specified by parameters and the third is the "help.hlp" file containing general 
help information pertaining to the system as a whole, like standardized function 
keys and such. If any of the files do not exist, they are simply ignored. 
However, by supplying "help.hlp", all windows will at least have some help text. 
The help window appears at the top left corner of the screen and is as narrow 
and short as the help text permits.</P>
<P>2 parameters:<BR><STRONG>File1</STRONG>: The name of the first help text 
file. Typically, this file contains the most specific information about the 
current function.<BR><STRONG>File2</STRONG>: The name of the second help text 
file.</P>
<H3><A name=Disptitle>Disptitle</A></H3>
<P>Displays a title line to the current window. This function is used by other 
Power-4gl user interface functions but may also be used in any window, for 
example, with input forms so that the window title is displayed with special 
attributes or colors.</P>
<P>2 parameters:<BR><STRONG>Name</STRONG>: The title name. This can be the title 
text itself or a key value to the title text table.<BR><STRONG>Type</STRONG>: 
The window type. This is used in conjunction with the name as part of the key 
value to the title text table. If an entry exists in the title table for the 
given name and type, then the corresponding title text is used which can be more 
than one line of text. Otherwise the name is used as the title text.</P>
<H3><A name=Winform>Winform</A></H3>
<P>Opens a bordered window with a form at a given position. If the window cannot 
be opened at the given position, the window is adjusted in an attempt to solve 
the problem.</P>
<P>3 parameters:<BR><STRONG>Name</STRONG>: The form 
name.<BR><STRONG>Row</STRONG>: The screen row position. If the row is 1 then a 
full screen window is assumed.<BR><STRONG>Column</STRONG>: The screen column 
position. If the row is 1 then a full screen window is assumed.</P>
<H3><A name=Winopen>Winopen</A></H3>

cannot be opened at the given position, the window is adjusted in an attempt to 
solve the problem.</P>

(optional).<BR><STRONG>Row</STRONG>: The screen row position. If the row is 1
