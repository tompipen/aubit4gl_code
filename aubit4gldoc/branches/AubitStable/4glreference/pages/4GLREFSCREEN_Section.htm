<B>SCREEN Section 
<P></P>
</B>The SCREEN section of the form specification file specifies the vertical and
horizontal dimensions of the physical screen, and the position of one or more
display fields and other information that will appear on the screen form. This
section is required. It has the following syntax: 
<P></P>
<IMG SRC="4GLREF00000028.gif" ALT="4GLREF00000028.gif" BORDER="0" USEMAP="#map7" WIDTH="573" HEIGHT="55"><MAP NAME="map7"><AREA COORDS="367,13,447,37" HREF="4GLREFSCREEN_Section.htm#074959e1"></MAP>
<P></P>
<B>lines</B> is a literal integer that specifies how many lines of characters (measured
vertically) the form can display. The default is 24. 
<P></P>
<B>characters</B> is a literal integer, specifying how many characters (measured horizontally) a
line can display. The default is the maximum number of characters in any line
of the screen-layout. 
<P></P>
The SCREEN keyword is required. As in other sections of a form specification
file, the keyword END is not required, but it is recognized by the Form Compiler
to provide compatibility with earlier Informix products. 
<P></P>
A single pair of braces ( { } ) symbols, immediately preceded and immediately
followed by Newline characters, must enclose the screen-layout. Do not use
braces ( { } ) as comment indicators within the SCREEN section. 
<P></P>

</B>The screen-layout of the SCREEN section must be enclosed in braces ( { } ). It
consists of display fields and (optionally) text characters.
