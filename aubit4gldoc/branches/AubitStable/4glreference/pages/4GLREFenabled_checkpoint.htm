<B>enabled checkpoint
<P></P>
</B>A checkpoint that is active. That is, it suspends execution or triggers a
debugging request when the 4GL application accesses the target of the checkpoint.
You can disable a checkpoint when it is inconvenient and enable it again when
you want to inspect the entity to which the checkpoint applies.
