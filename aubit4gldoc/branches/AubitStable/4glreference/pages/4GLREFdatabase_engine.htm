<B>database engine
<P></P>
</B>The part of a database management system that manipulates data files. This
process receives SQL statements from the database application, parses them,
optimizes the approach to the data, retrieves the data from the database, and returns
the data to the application. Informix provides two database engines:
INFORMIX-OnLine and INFORMIX-SE (both UNIX and DOS versions). The database engine is
also called the back end, database server, or database agent.
