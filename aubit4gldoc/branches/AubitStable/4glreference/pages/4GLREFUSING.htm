DATE operand, and returns the formatted value.

<P></P>
<B>format-string</B> is a quoted string that specifies how to format the returned character string
from the number or time expression. 
<P></P>
With a number or MONEY operand, you can use the USING operator to align
decimal points or currency symbols, to right- or left-justify numbers, to put
negative numbers in parentheses, and to perform other formatting tasks. USING can also
convert a DATE operand to a variety of formats.
<P></P>
USING is typically used in DISPLAY or PRINT statements, but you can also use
it with LET to assign the formatted value to a character variable. If a value is
too large for the field, 4GL fills it with asterisks ( * ) to indicate an
overflow.
