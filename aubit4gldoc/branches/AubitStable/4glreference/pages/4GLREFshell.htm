<B>shell
<P></P>
</B>A process that handles the user interaction with the operating system. From
the shell, the user can execute operating system commands. A shell is usually
provided to contain activity in a particular part of the computer system. In DOS,
for example, the shell handles command line input, and standard output and
error reporting. DOS shells have their own special commands that are not usable
within applications. They even have their own special variables and scripting
facilities that make the user interface customizable.
