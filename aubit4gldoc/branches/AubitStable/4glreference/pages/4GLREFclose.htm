<B>close

</B>To cease to use an open entity. In programming, closing something releases
control of it and deallocates any resources that it used. For example, when you
close a database cursor, you release any memory or disk space that was used to
hold the active set for that cursor. When you close a file, you tell the system
that you no longer require the file and others can use it. When you close a
form, you release any memory or disk used to store it. When you close a 4GL window,
you deallocate memory for the image of the window and pop it from the window
stack. Typically things cannot be closed until they have been opened.
