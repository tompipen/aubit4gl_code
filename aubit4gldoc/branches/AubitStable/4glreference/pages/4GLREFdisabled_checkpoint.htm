<B>disabled checkpoint
<P></P>
</B>A checkpoint that is inactive. That is, it has been defined but that has no
effect on the execution of the 4GL application. You can disable a checkpoint when
it is inconvenient and enable the checkpoint when you want to inspect the
entity to which the checkpoint applies.
