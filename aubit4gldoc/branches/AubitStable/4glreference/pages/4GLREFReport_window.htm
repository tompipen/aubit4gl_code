<B>Report window
<P></P>
</B>A separate GUI window that displays report output for a 4GL application when
output is directed to the screen. It contains a menu for paging through the
report. The behavior of the Report window depends on the logic of the 4GL program:
if the report includes a PAUSE statement, the Report window is modeless and the
user retains access to the Application and Help windows; if no PAUSE statement
is included, the Report window is modal, taking control of the application
until the user dismisses it.
