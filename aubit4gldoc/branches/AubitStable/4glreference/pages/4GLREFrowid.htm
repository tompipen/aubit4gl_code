<B>rowid
<P></P>
</B>A hidden, automatically-generated column in each table of an Informix
database. It uniquely identifies a row based on its position within the table. A rowid
number is assigned when each row is added to a table and released when a row is
deleted. Once assigned, the rowid for a particular row cannot be changed and
the rowid number cannot be reused for that particular table.
