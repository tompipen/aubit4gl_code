<B>Interrupt key
<P></P>
</B>The logical key that the user can press within a 4GL application to indicate
cancellation of the user interaction statement. If the 4GL program does not
include the DEFER INTERRUPT statement, pressing this key terminates program
execution. With DEFER INTERRUPT, pressing the Interrupt key sets the built-in int_flag
variable to TRUE and cancels the current interaction statement, resuming
execution at the next 4GL statement. However, further response to the Interrupt
signal may be deferred until the next pause for user input. The physical key for
Interrupt is CONTROL-C.
