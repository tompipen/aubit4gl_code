</B>The PAUSE statement temporarily suspends the Application window during the
screen output from a 4GL report, until the user chooses the Resume option of the
Report window menu. The PAUSE statement can only appear in the FORMAT section of
a REPORT program block.

<B>string</B>  is a quoted string. (This specification has no effect on Windows systems, but
is supported for compatibility with INFORMIX-4GL programs that are developed
for character environments.)
<P></P>
The PAUSE statement affects the behavior of the Report window and the
Application window. It has no effect on the formatted report output:
<P></P>
In the absence of a PAUSE statement, the Report window is modeless, like the
Help window; the user has simultaneous access to all graphical and 4GL windows.
<P></P>
If a PAUSE statement appears in the REPORT definition, the Report window
becomes modal, taking exclusive control of the 4GL application until the user closes
it by choosing Resume from its menu. (Users can access other DOS windows, but
they cannot access the Application window, nor any of its 4GL windows, until
after the Report window closes.)
<P></P>
Your users should be advised that an application can appear suspended if the
user closes a modal Report window by using the System menu button on its window
frame, rather than the Resume menu option.
<P></P>
The PAUSE statement has no effect if you include a REPORT TO clause in the
OUTPUT section, or a TO clause in the START REPORT statement.
