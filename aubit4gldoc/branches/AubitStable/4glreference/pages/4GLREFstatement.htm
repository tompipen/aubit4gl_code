<B>statement
<P></P>
</B>An instruction that 4GL executes. This instruction is a single executable unit
of program code but may cover several lines within the source module. For
example, the FOR statement may have several lines between the line introduced with
the FOR keyword and the line introduced with END FOR keywords. However, the FOR
statement is a single statement because it performs a single action. During
program execution, the statement currently being executed is often called the
current statement. A statement is distinct from a command: the LET or PRINT
command is executed by the INFORMIX-4GL Interactive Debugger; the LET or PRINT
statement can be compiled and executed by 4GL.
