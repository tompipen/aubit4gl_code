</B>The set of identifiers of different types whose names must be unique within
the same scope. For example, the following types of identifiers have the same
name space: cursor names, window names, form names, function names, global
variable names, and report names. Because they share the same name space, none of them
can have the same name: a cursor cannot have the same name as a window or a
global variable; however, a cursor could have the same name as a local variable
as long as the cursor did not appear within the same scope as the local
variable.
