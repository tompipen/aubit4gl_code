<B>precedence of operators
<P></P>
</B>The hierarchy of operators. It determines the order in which 4GL evaluates
operators within an expression. 4GL evaluates higher precedence operators before
those of lower precedence. The order in which operators at the same precedence
level are evaluated is left to right. Precedence order can be changed by
surrounding expressions with parentheses.
