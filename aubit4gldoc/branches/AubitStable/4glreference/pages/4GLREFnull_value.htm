<P></P>
</B><OL><LI> A value that means not known or not applicable. A null value is distinct from
a string of blanks or from a value of zero. Database columns and program
variables can have null values. In 4GL, this marker referred to by the keyword NULL.
To test for a null value, use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators.

<OL START="2"><LI> In other contexts, null is casually used to mean empty; for example, a
character string with zero length is sometimes called the null string. This can lead
to confusion because an empty string (the string  ) has a specific non-null
value, distinct from a NULL string. An empty string has a definite length (zero)
while a NULL character value has an unknown length and value.
