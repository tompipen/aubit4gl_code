<B>4GL window
<P></P>
</B>A rectangular region in the Application window, possibly one of many, managed
by a 4GL application. 4GL windows are not treated by the window manager as
separate graphical windows. The default 4GL window, open in every application, is
called the screen. The OPEN WINDOW statement creates a new 4GL window. 4GL
manages its windows with a stack. Each window is pushed onto this stack when it is
opened. A 4GL program performs its input and output in the current window.
