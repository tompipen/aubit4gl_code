<B>Formatted mode
<P></P>
</B>An output mode of a 4GL program in which screen addressing is used. 4GL enters
this mode when it executes any 4GL user interaction or output statement
(ERROR, MESSAGE, DISPLAY AT, and so on) except a simple DISPLAY (one without an AT,
BY NAME, or TO clause). Output in Formatted mode displays in the Application
window. It should not be mixed with Line mode. Sometimes called Windows mode and
Format mode.
