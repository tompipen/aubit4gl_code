<B>BEFORE GROUP OF
<P></P>
</B>The BEFORE GROUP OF control block specifies the action that INFORMIX-4GL takes
before it processes a group of records. Grouping is determined by the ORDER BY
specification in the SELECT statement or in the REPORT routine.

<B><UL><LI>ariable</B>  is the name of a variable from the list of arguments to the REPORT routine.
You must pass at least the value of variable through the arguments of the REPORT
routine.
<P></P>
</UL><B>statement</B> is a Report execution statement or other 4GL statement. 
<P></P>
A group of records is all of the input records that contain the same value for
the variable specified after the BEFORE GROUP OF keywords. This group variable
must be passed through the report arguments. A report can include no more than
one BEFORE GROUP OF control block for each group variable. 
<P></P>
When 4GL executes the statements in a BEFORE GROUP OF control block, the
report variables have the values from the first record of the new group. From this
perspective, the BEFORE GROUP OF control block could be thought of as the on
first record of group control block.
