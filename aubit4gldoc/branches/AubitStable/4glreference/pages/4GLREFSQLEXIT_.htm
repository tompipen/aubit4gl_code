</B>The SQLEXIT( ) function terminates the connection of the 4GL application to
the database server, and returns a status code of zero. (No compilation error
occurs if your application ignores this returned value.)

<P></P>
On a Windows system that uses version 4.1 of INFORMIX-NET PC, only one 4GL
application at a given time can have a connection to an SQL database server. If
two or more 4GL applications are running, and a connection is already open, the
4GL application that has the connection must first invoke the SQLEXIT( )
function before any other 4GL application or development tool like the PEM, Source
Compiler, or Form Compiler can connect to a database. (Otherwise, runtime error
-854 occurs.)
<P></P>
SQLEXIT( ) rolls back any open transaction, closes the current database, and
terminates the INFORMIX-NET PC or local pstartsql connection and any client
process supporting the 4GL application on a remote server. If the current database
is remote, or if it uses transaction logging, first issue the CLOSE DATABASE
statement before calling SQLEXIT( ). To verify that the rollback or database
closure succeeded, examine the SQLCA record.
