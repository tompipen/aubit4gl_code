<P></P>
</B>The executable form of an SQL statement. SQL statements can be executed
dynamically by creating character strings with the text of the statement. This
character string must then be prepared with the PREPARE statement. The result of the
PREPARE is a prepared statement. The prepared statement can then be executed
with the EXECUTE or DECLARE statements.
