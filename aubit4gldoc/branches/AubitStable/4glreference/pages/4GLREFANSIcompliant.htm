</B>A database that conforms to certain ANSI (American National Standards
Institute) performance standards. Informix databases can be created either as
ANSI-compliant or as not ANSI-compliant. An ANSI-compliant database enforces ANSI
requirements such as implicit transactions, required owner-naming, and no buffered
logging. The term MODE ANSI is sometimes used to refer to an ANSI-compliant
database.
