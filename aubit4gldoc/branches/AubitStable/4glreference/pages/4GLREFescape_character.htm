<B>escape character
<P></P>
</B>A character which indicates that the following character, normally interpreted
by a program, is to be printed as a literal character instead. Usually
programs which handle user input (such as text editors and shells) have some
characters which have special interpreted meanings. The escape character is used in
conjunction with the interpreted character to escape or ignore the interpreted
meaning. The ASCII escape character is a non-printing character with value of ASCII
27. In 4GL, the backlash ( \ ) symbol can be used as an escape character: the
string \\ would indicate that the backslash character is to be sent.
