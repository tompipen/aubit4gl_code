<B>data type conversion
<P></P>
</B>The process of interpreting and storing a value of one data type as some other
data type; sometimes called simply data conversion. The pairs of data types
for which data conversion is possible without error are called compatible data
types. This process can be automatic or explicit. 4GL performs some automatic
data conversion in expressions and assignment. It also provides facilities to
perform some explicit data conversion (for example the EXTEND( ) function). In
addition, the LIKE keyword, when used in a variable definition, provides indirect
data typing.
