<B>ORDER BY Section
<P></P>
</B>The ORDER BY section specifies how to sort input records, and determines the
sequence of execution of GROUP OF control blocks in the <A HREF="4GLREFFORMAT_Section.htm">FORMAT section</A>. 
<P></P>
<IMG SRC="4GLREF00000011.gif" ALT="4GLREF00000011.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="542" HEIGHT="108">
<P></P>
<B><UL><LI>ariable</B> is the name of an argument from the report prototype. The list of variables
that you specify here is called the sort list.
<P></P>
</UL>The ORDER BY section specifies a sort list for the input records. Include this
section if the values that the REPORT routine receives from the <A HREF="4GLREFINFORMIX4GL_Reports_Overview.htm#804c3110">report driver</A> have not been ordered and you want the report to contain ordered data. 
<P></P>
If you omit the ORDER BY section, 4GL processes input records in the order in
which they are passed by the report driver, and processes any GROUP OF control
blocks in the order of their appearance in the FORMAT section. If the records
are not sorted in the report driver, any GROUP OF control blocks are likely to
be executed after each input record, because the unsorted values tend to change
from record to record.
<P></P>
If you specify only one variable in the GROUP OF control blocks, and the input
records are already sorted by the SELECT statement, then you do not need to
include an ORDER BY section in the report.
<P></P>
Specify ORDER EXTERNAL BY if the report contains GROUP BY control blocks that
specify more than one variable, and the input records have already been sorted
by the SELECT statement. The variables after the keywords ORDER EXTERNAL BY
control the execution order of GROUP BY control blocks.
<P></P>
Without the EXTERNAL keyword, INFORMIX-4GL makes two passes through the input
records. During the first pass, it sorts the data and stores the sorted values
in a temporary file. During the second pass, it calculates any aggregate
values, and produces output from data in the temporary files.
<P></P>
With the EXTERNAL keyword, INFORMIX-4GL only needs to make a single pass
through the data: it does not need to build the temporary table in the database for
sorting the data. Specifying EXTERNAL to instruct 4GL not to sort the records
again may result in an improvement in performance.
<P></P>
The EXTERNAL keyword in the ORDER BY section instructs the report to accept
the input records without sorting them. Without this keyword, the report needs
access to a database to create its temporary table for sorting. (If no database
is open and you run a two-pass report, a run-time error occurs when 4GL cannot
create the temporary table.)
<P></P>
If the input records for your report come from the rows returned by only one
cursor, you should use the ORDER BY clause in the SELECT statement that is
associated with the cursor, and then use the EXTERNAL keyword in the ORDER BY
section of your report.
