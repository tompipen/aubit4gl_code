</B><OL><LI> An area for holding a data value. Usually refers to a delimited, unprotected
area on a screen form used for entry and display of a data value. Such fields
can have field attributes associated with them that control, for example, the
case of letters, default values, and so on. When a form is active, the location
of the cursor designates what is called the current field, the field in which
the user can enter data. A field on a screen form corresponds to a column in a
database, unless it has been defined as a form-only field.
