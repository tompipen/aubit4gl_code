<B>identifier
<P></P>
</B>A sequence of letters, digits, and symbols which the compiler recognizes as a
programmer-defined name of some entity. In 4GL, an identifier can include
letters, digits, and underscore symbols ( _ ). It must have either a letter or an
underscore ( _ ) as the first character. It can be up to 50 characters in length
but the first seven must be unique among similar program entities that have the
same scope of reference. 4GL does not distinguish between upper and lowercase
letters. Types of identifiers include variable names, cursor names, function
names, report names, table names, window names, form names, prepared statement
names, and report names.
