<B>BYTE variable</B> is the identifier of an 4GL variable of data type BYTE.
<P></P>
<B>filename</B> is a character string, enclosed between quotation ( &quot; ) marks, and specifying
the name of an <A HREF="4GLREFASCII00000025.htm">ASCII</A> file to include in the output from the report. The filename can include a
path name.
<P></P>
<B>left offset</B> is an expression that evaluates to a positive whole number, specifying a
character position offset (from the left margin) no greater than the difference
(right margin - left margin).
<P></P>
<B>relative offset</B> is an expression that evaluates to a positive whole number, specifying an
offset (from the current character position) no greater than the difference (right
margin - current position).
<P></P>
<B>temporary</B> is an expression that evaluates to a positive whole number, specifying the
absolute position of a temporary right margin. 
<P></P>
<B>TEXT variable</B> is the identifier of an 4GL variable of the TEXT data type.
<P></P>
This statement can include character data in the form of an ASCII file, a TEXT
variable, or a comma-separated expression list of character expressions in the
output of the report. (For a TEXT variable or filename, you cannot specify
additional output in the same PRINT statement.) You cannot display a BYTE value.
Unless its scope of reference is global or the current module, any program
variable in expression list must be declared in the <A HREF="4GLREFDEFINE_Section.htm">DEFINE section</A>.
<P></P>
Output is sent to the file, pipe, or device specified in the REPORT TO clause
of the <A HREF="4GLREFOUTPUT_Section.htm">OUTPUT section</A>, or in the TO clause of the START REPORT statement of the calling routine.
Otherwise, the screen displays the output.

<A NAME="16344de9"></A><B>Aggregate Report Functions 
<P></P>
</B>Aggregate report functions summarize data from several records in a report.
The syntax and effects of these functions in a report resemble those of SQL
aggregate functions, but are not identical.
<P></P>
<IMG SRC="4GLREF00000024.gif" ALT="4GLREF00000024.gif" BORDER="0" USEMAP="#map5" WIDTH="672" HEIGHT="188"><MAP NAME="map5"><AREA COORDS="269,144,383,178" HREF="4GLREFExpressions_of_4GL.htm"><AREA COORDS="519,52,608,99" HREF="4GLREF4GL_Boolean_Expressions.htm"><AREA COORDS="268,104,385,137" HREF="4GLREFTime_Expressions.htm#7ecb4334"><AREA COORDS="268,63,388,96" HREF="4GLREFNumber_Expressions.htm"></MAP>
<P></P>
The expression (in parentheses) that SUM( ), AVG( ), MIN( ), or MAX( ) take as
an argument is typically of a number or INTERVAL data type; large binary and
structured data types are not valid. The AVG( ), SUM( ), MIN( ), and MAX( )
aggregates all ignore records for which their arguments have NULL values, but each
returns NULL if every record has a NULL value for the argument.
<P></P>
<B>The GROUP Keyword
<P></P>
</B>This optional keyword causes the <A HREF="4GLREFaggregate_function.htm">aggregate function</A> to include data only for a group of records that have the same value on a
variable that you specify in an AFTER GROUP OF control block. An aggregate
function can only include the GROUP keyword within an AFTER GROUP OF control block.
<P></P>
<B>The WHERE Clause
<P></P>
</B>The optional WHERE clause allows you to select among records passed to the
report, so that only records for which the Boolean expression is TRUE are included.
<P></P>
<B>The AVG( ) and SUM( ) Aggregates 
<P></P>
</B>These evaluate as the average (that is, the arithmetic mean value) and the
total (respectively) of expression among all records, or among records qualified
by the optional WHERE clause and any GROUP specification. 
<P></P>
<B>The COUNT ( * ) and PERCENT ( * ) Aggregates
<P></P>
</B>These return, respectively, the total number of records qualified by the
optional WHERE clause, and the percentage of the total number of records in the
report. You must include the ( * ) symbols. 
<P></P>
<B>The MIN( ) and MAX( ) Aggregates
<P></P>
</B>These evaluates as the minimum value and maximum value (respectively) for
expression among all records, or among records qualified by the optional WHERE
clause and any GROUP specification. For character data, greater than means after in
the <A HREF="4GLREFASCII00000025.htm">ASCII</A> collating sequence, where a&gt; A&gt; 1, and less than means before in the ASCII
sequence, where 1&lt; A&lt; a. For DATETIME or DATE data, greater than means later and
less than means earlier in time. Appendix A lists the ASCII collating sequence.
