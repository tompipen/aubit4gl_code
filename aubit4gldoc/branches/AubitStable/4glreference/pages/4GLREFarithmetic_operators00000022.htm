</B>Operators that perform arithmetic operations on operands of number (and some
time) data types. The following are 4GL binary arithmetic operators: addition (
+ ), subtraction ( - ), multiplication ( * ), division ( / ), exponentiation (
** ), and modulus (MOD). 4GL unary arithmetic operators are: unary minus ( - )
and unary plus ( + ). The following precedence is for arithmetic operators:
(highest) unary minus and plus; (next highest) exponentiation, modulus; (next
highest) multiplication, division; (lowest) addition, subtraction. Arithmetic
operators yield a numeric result.
