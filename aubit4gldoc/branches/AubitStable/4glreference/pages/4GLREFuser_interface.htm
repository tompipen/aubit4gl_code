<B>user interface
<P></P>
</B>The point in a software or hardware system at which communication to or from a
human can occur. In software systems, it is that part of a program that waits
for input from the user of that program and displays output based on that users
input. Typical user interfaces include menus, prompts, screen forms, and
on-line help messages.
