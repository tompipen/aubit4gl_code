<P></P>
</B>A special variable with a value that is maintained by the operating system and
made available to all programs. They are usually stored in a special system
area and contain system specifics such as the path (the directories in which the
operating system looks for user-invoked commands). In DOS, an environment
variable is sometimes referred to as an environment entry.
