</UL></B>A formalized way of implementing a query. The CONSTRUCT statement allows the
user to enter query criteria on a screen form and creates a Boolean expression
based on these criteria. This Boolean expression can then be appended to an SQL
statement (usually a SELECT) to retrieve the desired rows from the database.
The SQL statement must then be prepared and executed.
