<B>compiler directive
<P></P>
</B>An instruction within a source module to a compiler, as opposed to an
executable statement. In the C language, directives can address the preprocessor
portion of the compilation, requesting, for example, conditional compilation or
inclusion of a named file. In 4GL, the WHENEVER and DEFER statements are compiler
directive. The effect of the WHENEVER lasts until the end of the source file (or
until overridden by another WHENEVER).
