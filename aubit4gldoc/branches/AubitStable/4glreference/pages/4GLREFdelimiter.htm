<B>delimiter
<P></P>
</B>A character that separates one unit of text from another. The eye can easily
see boundaries based on context, but programs need unambiguous marker characters
to detect the end of one item and the start of the next. In data produced by
the UNLOAD statement, the data from each column ends with a delimiter ( | by
default) so that the LOAD command can recognize the end. In the form specification
file, brackets ( [] ) mark or delimit the fields of the form.
