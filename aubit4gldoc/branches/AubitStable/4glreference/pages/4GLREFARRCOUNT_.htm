<B>ARR_COUNT( )
<P></P>
</B>The ARR_COUNT( ) function returns a positive whole number, typically
representing how many records were entered in a program array during or after execution
of the INPUT ARRAY statement.

You can use ARR_COUNT( ) to determine the number of program records that are
currently stored in a program array. In typical 4GL applications, these records
correspond to values from the active set of retrieved database rows from the
most recent query. By first calling the SET_COUNT( ) function, you can set an
upper limit on the value that ARR_COUNT( ) returns.
<P></P>
ARR_COUNT( ) returns a positive integer, corresponding to the index of the
furthest record within the program array that the screen cursor accessed. Not all
the rows counted by ARR_COUNT( ) necessarily contain data (for example, if the
user presses the Down arrow key more times than there are rows of data). If
SET_COUNT( ) was explicitly called, ARR_COUNT( ) returns the greater of these two
values: the argument of SET_COUNT( ), or the highest value attained by the
array index.
