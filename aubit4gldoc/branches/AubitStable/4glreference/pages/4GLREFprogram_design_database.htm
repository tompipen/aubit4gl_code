<B>program design database
<P></P>
</B>A database that describes the resources needed to create various executable
programs. It is called syspg4gl (by default), and is accessed by the Programmers
Environment Manager (PEM). Regardless of the compiler being used (C code or
p-code), this database tracks for each 4GL program such resources as source files
and compiler options.
