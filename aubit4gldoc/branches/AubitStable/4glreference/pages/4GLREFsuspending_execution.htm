<B>suspending execution
<P></P>
</B>Interrupting or pausing execution of the 4GL application. A 4GL application
suspends execution at a user interaction statement, when the program attempts to
place a lock on data that is already locked by another program (when it has set
its lock mode to WAIT), or with the SLEEP statement. You can also control
execution by running the program with the INFORMIX-4GL Interactive Debugger. Within
the Debugger, you can suspend execution on reaching a breakpoint or some
condition, or after execution of a requested number of lines.
