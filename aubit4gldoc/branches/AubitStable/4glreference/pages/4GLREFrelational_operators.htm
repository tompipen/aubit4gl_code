<B>relational operators
<P></P>
</B>Operators that perform comparison operations. These operators return the
values TRUE (=1), FALSE (=0), and in some cases UNKNOWN (If an operand evaluates to
NULL, Boolean operators can yield a third unknown result that 4GL treats as
FALSE). 4GL relational operators are: equal (=), not equal (!= or &lt;&gt;), greater
than (&gt;), less than (&lt;), greater than or equal to (&gt;=), less than or equal to
(&lt;=). All relational operators have the same precedence level.
