</B>A peripheral device usually centered around a raster screen. Terminals usually
come with keyboards, and are used by the user of a computer system to
communicate with the computer by typing commands in and looking at the output on the
screen. Terminals are often character-based and are thereby distinguishable from
displays which are usually graphical. Terminals support monochrome or color
output, depending on their designed capabilities and computer system
configuration.
