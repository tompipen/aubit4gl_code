</B><OL><LI> In a database, a row is a set of related values, called columns, stored
together in a table. A table holds a collection of rows, each one distinct from the
others in the contents of its key. In other database terminologies, a row is
sometimes called a record or a tuple.

<OL START="2"><LI> In a screen form, a row is the visible display of the values from one
database row. The row (of data fields on the screen) may or may not be identical to a
row (of values in a table in the database). A single line of a screen array is
sometimes called a row.

<OL START="3"><LI> In a report, a row is the information sent by the report driver function. A
4GL program generates a report by sending rows of data to a report function.
These rows may or may not correspond to database rows. These rows are called input
records.

<OL START="4"><LI> On a screen, a row is the y-coordinate of a particular position. The
x-coordinate is called a column. Several 4GL statements use rows and columns in this
sense to identify location of display.
