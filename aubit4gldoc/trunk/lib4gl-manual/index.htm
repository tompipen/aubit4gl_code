<P>Power-4gl is a tool-kit which greatly enhances the x-4gl programming 
environment by adding a robust family of general purpose functions. In 
particular, the package enables easy production of friendly and sophisticated 
user interface objects and reports.</P>
<P>Power-4gl was initially written by <a href="mailto:john@rl.is">John H. Frantz</a>,
and donated to <a href="http://aubit4gl.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">Aubit
4gl project</a>, where it is extended, and maintained as part of Aubit 4gl
OpenSource development process.&nbsp; By preserving compatibility with other <a href="http://aubit4gl.sourceforge.net/aubit4gldoc/4glreference/index.htm" target="_blank">x4gl
language</a> compilers, intention is for Power-4GL to become standard 4gl
functions library for all users of <a href="http://aubit4gl.sourceforge.net/pages/x4gl_compilers_compared.htm" target="_blank">x4gl
compatible compilers</a>.&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Features</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Consistent user interface model based on presenting the user with windowed 
  lists which can be of four basic types: 
  <OL>
    <LI>Vertical menus in cascading windows that allow the menu "trail" to be 
    visible. 
    <LI>Flexible pick-lists that can join tables, present positional and summary 
    information, output the lists to printers or files, mark rows and much more. 

    <LI>Reports that appear on screen where they can be scrolled vertically and 
    horizontally before being sent to printers or files. 
    <LI>Help windows that concatenate ordinary editable text files and present 
    them in a scrollable window. </LI></OL>
  <LI>Enhanced printing capabilities include character formatting, page length 
  adjustment and printer control. 
  <LI>Library of over a hundred general purpose routines for text handling, 
  arithmetic operations, and screen objects such as message and prompt windows. 
  <LI>Keyboard mapping to logical and descriptive values such as "insert", 
  "home", "refresh" and "exit". 
  <LI>Extensive code reusability. 
  <LI>Language, system, and 4gl compiler independence. 
  <LI>Included as standard 4gl function library with Aubit 4gl compiler. 
  <LI>Source code included under GNU GPL license. </LI> 
  <LI>Developed and maintained as part of OpenSource project. </LI></UL>
