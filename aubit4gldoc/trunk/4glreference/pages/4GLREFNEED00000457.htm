<B>lines</B> is an integer expression that specifies how many lines must remain in the
current page between the line above the current character position and the bottom
margin.
<P></P>
The NEED statement causes subsequent report output from the PRINT statement to
start on the next page of the report, if fewer than the specified number of
available lines remain between the current line of the page and the bottom
margin. NEED has the effect of a conditional SKIP TO TOP OF PAGE, the condition being
that the number returned by the integer expression must be greater than the
number of lines that remain on the current page.
