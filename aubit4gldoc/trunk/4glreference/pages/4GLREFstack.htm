<B>stack
<P></P>
</B>A data structure that stores information linearly with all operations
performed at one end (the top). Such types of data structures are often called LIFO
(last-in, first-out) structures. Stack operations include push, which adds a new
piece of data to the top of the stack, and pop, which removes the piece of
information at the top of the stack. 4GL uses one stack to transfer arguments to C
functions and another to keep track of open 4GL windows.
