</B>The 4GL program block (including MAIN, a function, or a report) that is
currently the focus of the debugging. The inspected function is always both
accessible and active. The default scope during debugging requests is determined from
the inspected function. That is, the local variables of the inspected function
are the only local variables in scope during debugging requests. The default
inspected function is the suspended function. You can view accessible functions
within the INFORMIX-4GL Interactive Debugger.
