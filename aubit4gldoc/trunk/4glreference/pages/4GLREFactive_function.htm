</B>A 4GL program block (including MAIN, a function, or a report) that has started
execution but not completed execution. The active functions consist of all
functions on the call stackthat is, of the current function and all functions that
are waiting for a function call to return. The MAIN program block is always
active for the program session. You can inspect active functions within the
INFORMIX-4GL Interactive Debugger.
