<B>CHAR
<P></P>
</B>The CHAR data type of 4GL can store any ASCII character string, up to a length
specified between parentheses ( ( ) ) symbols in the size parameter of the
DEFINE statement that declares the data type. The size can range from 1 to 32,767. 
<P></P>
The resulting default CHAR data type can store only a single character. In a
form, you cannot specify the size of a FORMONLY CHAR field; the size defaults to
the field length from the screen layout. On the INFORMIX-SE engine, the
maximum data string length that a CHAR column can store is 32,511.   
<P></P>
The CHAR data type requires one byte of storage per character, or size bytes.
When a string value is passed between a CHAR variable and a CHAR database
column, or between two CHAR variables, exactly size bytes of data are transferred,
for size the declared length of the 4GL variable or the database column that
receives the string. If the length of the data string is shorter than this size,
the string is padded with trailing blank spaces to fill the declared size. If
the string is longer than size, then the stored value is truncated. A character
string returned by a function can contain no more than 511 bytes of data. 
<P></P>
To perform arithmetic on numbers stored in variables, use a number data type.
CHAR variables can store digits, but you might not be able to use them in some
calculations. Similarly, leading zeros (as in some postal codes) are stripped
from values stored as the number data types INTEGER or SMALLINT. You should
store such values as CHAR data types.
