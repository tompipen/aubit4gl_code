<B>REPORT Control Blocks
<P></P>
</B>The control blocks determine when INFORMIX-4GL takes an action in a report;
within each control block, the statements determine what action INFORMIX-4GL
takes. The list of statements within a control block terminates when another
control block begins, or when the END REPORT keywords that terminate the REPORT
program block are encountered. You can include most INFORMIX-4GL statements in a
control block, as well as several statements that can be used only in the <A HREF="4GLREFFORMAT_Section.htm">FORMAT section</A> of a REPORT routine. 
<P></P>
<B>Standard 4GL Statements 
<P></P>
</B>The most common INFORMIX-4GL statements used in the control blocks of reports
are CASE, FOR, IF, LET, and WHILE. These statements have the same syntax that
they have elsewhere in 4GL applications. (Remember that any local variables
referenced in such statements must be declared in the <A HREF="4GLREFDEFINE_Section.htm">DEFINE section</A> of the REPORT routine.)
