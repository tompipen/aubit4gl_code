</B>To store a value in a variable. The 4GL assignment operator is the LET
statement. 4GL evaluates the expression on the right-hand side of the = and assigns it
to the variable listed on the left-hand side. You can also assign values to a
variable with the following 4GL statements: CALL...RETURNING, FOREACH...INTO,
INITIALIZE, INPUT, INPUT ARRAY, and PROMPT; and with the INTO clause of the SQL
SELECT statement. In evaluation of expressions, assignment has the lowest
precedence.
