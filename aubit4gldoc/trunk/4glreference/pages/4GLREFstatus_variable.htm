<B>status variable
<P></P>
</B>The built-in variable which 4GL sets after executing each SQL and form-related
statement. If the statement is successful, status is set to zero. If the value
of status is negative, 4GL terminates program execution unless the program
contains the appropriate error handling. After execution of SQL statements, 4GL
copies the value of SQLCA.SQLCODE into status.
