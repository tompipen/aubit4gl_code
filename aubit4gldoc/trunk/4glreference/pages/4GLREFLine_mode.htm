<B>Line mode
<P></P>
</B>An output mode of a 4GL program which produces a scrolling, character-based
display interface. Screen addressing is not used. 4GL enters this mode and
displays the Line-mode overlay when it executes a simple DISPLAY statement (one
without an AT, BY NAME, or TO clause).4GL remains in Line mode as long as it
encounters additional simple DISPLAY statements or the PROMPT statement. When it
encounters any other output statement (ERROR, DISPLAY AT, and so on) or a user
interaction statement, 4GL returns to Formatted mode. Because this mode results in a
simple stream of characters to standard output, it should not be mixed with
Formatted mode.
