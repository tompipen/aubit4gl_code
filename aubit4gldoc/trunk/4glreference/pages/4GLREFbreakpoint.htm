</B>A checkpoint on a program entity that suspends program execution when the 4GL
application accesses the program entity. Possible program entities include: a
particular line of code, a variable, a condition, or a function. Breakpoints are
specified in the INFORMIX-4GL Interactive Debugger. After the breakpoint
suspends the program, you can inspect the 4GL application interactively.
