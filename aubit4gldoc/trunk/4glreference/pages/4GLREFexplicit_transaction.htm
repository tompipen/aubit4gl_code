<B>explicit transaction
<P></P>
</B>A transaction that the developer must explicitly begin and end. The BEGIN WORK
statement indicates the beginning of the transaction. The developer must
explicitly indicate the end of the transaction with the COMMIT WORK and ROLLBACK
WORK statement. A database that is not ANSI-compliant but that has a transaction
log uses explicit transactions.
