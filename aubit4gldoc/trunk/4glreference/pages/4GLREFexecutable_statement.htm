<B>executable statement
<P></P>
</B>A statement that requires processing action at run time. Executable statements
are distinguished from declarative statements (that provide information about
the nature of the data without themselves causing any processing) and compiler
directives which are instructions to the compiler. All 4GL statements are
executable except: MAIN, DEFINE, DEFER, FUNCTION, GLOBALS, REPORT, and WHENEVER.
