<B>fourth-generation language
<P></P>
</B><OL><LI> A programming language, closely approximating a natural language, designed
and developed for a particular class of applications. Because they focus on a
specific type of application, such languages can anticipate the types of actions
these programs need to perform. As a result, many typical operations can be
encapsulated into a single but powerful statement. Sometimes abbreviated as 4GL. 
<P></P>
<LI> 4GL is a fourth-generation language for the creation of database
applications. It includes the ability to embed SQL statements in a program as well as
providing additional statements, operators, and functions to assist in the creation
of database applications.
