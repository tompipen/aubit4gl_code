</B>To press a mouse button and then move the mouse cursor while holding down the
mouse button. In reference to a visual object, this means to point to the
object, press and hold the mouse button, and move the mouse cursor; in some cases,
the object follows the mouse cursor across the screen until the mouse button is
released. Dragging is used, for example, to resize a window by dragging its
frame, or to move a window by dragging its title bar.
