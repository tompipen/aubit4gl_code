<B>warning
<P></P>
</B>An exception which indicates an unexpected or abnormal condition that could
lead to an error in processing or data storage. Warnings can be generated because
of language syntax being used, when compiling source code or, because of a
variety of processing or data exceptions when running a program. At run time,
warnings can be generated by the program itself or by the database engine. By
default, 4GL continues execution when it encounters a warning. The developer can
change this default behavior with the WHENEVER WARNING statement.
