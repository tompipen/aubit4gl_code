<B>help file
<P></P>
</B>A file containing help messages for a 4GL application. Text associated with
each message must be uniquely identified within a given help file. You define a
help message in its source file (by default having a .MSG extension) and create
a compiled version (default .IEM extension) for use at run time. The Message
Compiler creates the compiled version. Sometimes this file is referred to as a
help message file.
