</UL><B>DEFINE Section
<P></P>
</B>This section declares the data type of each argument in the REPORT prototype,
and of any additional local variables that are referenced only within the
REPORT program block. The DEFINE section is required if you pass arguments to the
report, or if you reference local variables in the report.

<B><UL><LI>ariable</B>  is the identifier of a local variable that you declare here.
<P></P>
</UL>For declaring local variables, the same rules apply to the DEFINE section as
to the DEFINE statement in MAIN and FUNCTION program blocks. 
<P></P>
<B>Two exceptions, however, restrict the data types of formal arguments:
<P></P>
</B>Report argument cannot be of type ARRAY
<P></P>
Report argument cannot be records which have ARRAY members
<P></P>
<B>You must include arguments in the report prototype, and declare them in the
DEFINE section if one or more of the following conditions is true:
<P></P>
</B>When you use the FORMAT EVERY ROW specification for a default report. In this
case, you must pass all the values for each record of the report.
<P></P>
When there is an <A HREF="4GLREFORDER_BY_Section.htm">ORDER BY section</A> in the report. In this case, you must pass all the values for each record of
the report.
<P></P>
If an aggregate value that depends on all records of the report appears
anywhere except in the ON LAST ROW control block, then you must pass each of the
records of the report through the argument list. Examples of aggregates that depend
on all records include using GROUP PERCENT(*) anywhere in a report, or using
any aggregate without the GROUP keyword anywhere outside the ON LAST ROW control
block.
<P></P>
When you use the AFTER GROUP OF control block. In this case, you must pass at
least the arguments that are named in that control block.
<P></P>
The order of declarations in the DEFINE section is not restricted, but code
may be easier to read if you list arguments before local variables. If the DEFINE
section declares a variable or argument with the same identifier as a global
or module variable, that global or module variable is not visible in the report.
