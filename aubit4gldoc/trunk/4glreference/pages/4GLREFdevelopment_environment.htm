<B>development environment
<P></P>
</B>The special set of tools that a developer can use to develop computer
programs. This environment may include text editors, language compilers, function
libraries, program linkers, program debuggers, and other program utilities. Some of
these tools may be accessed by wrapper programs, which are executive programs
that decide which tools need to be run. The Programmers Environment Manager
(PEM) is an integrated development environment that combines many of these tools
into a single, cooperative environment.
