<B>program block
<P></P>
</B>A programmer-defined group of 4GL statements that has its own scope during
execution. The scope includes definitions and values of variables and may include
arguments and return values. 4GL has the following program blocks: a MAIN
program block, 4GL functions, and reports. Every executable statement must appear
within some program block. Program blocks can neither overlap nor be nested. Any
variable defined within a program block is local to that block.
