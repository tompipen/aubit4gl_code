one to which the WHENEVER statement or the GOTO statement can transfer program
control.

<B>label identifier</B> is a statement label, with a colon ( : ) as the last character. 
<P></P>
The LABEL statement indicates where to transfer control of program execution
within the same program block. Upon executing a GOTO or WHENEVER statement that
references the label identifier, 4GL jumps to the statement immediately
following the LABEL statement, skipping any intervening statements.
<P></P>
<B>The following restrictions apply to the LABEL statement:
<P></P>
</B>The label identifier must be unique within its program block.
<P></P>
To jump to a label, the GOTO or WHENEVER statement must use the same label
identifier as the LABEL statement above the desired statement.
<P></P>
The GOTO and LABEL (or the WHENEVER and LABEL) statements must both be in the
same MAIN, FUNCTION, or REPORT program block.
