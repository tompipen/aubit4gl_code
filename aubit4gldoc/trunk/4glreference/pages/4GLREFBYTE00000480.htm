<B>BYTE
<P></P>
</B>The BYTE data type stores any kind of binary data in an undifferentiated byte
stream. Binary data typically consist of saved spreadsheets, program load
modules, digitized voice patterns, and so on. The INFORMIX-SE database engine does
not support BYTE columns, but the 4GL application program can declare program
variables of the BYTE data type. The INFORMIX-OnLine engine can store data in
BYTE columns.
<P></P>
The data type BYTE has no maximum size; the theoretical limit 2**31 bytes, but
the practical limit is determined by the storage capacity of your system.
<P></P>
You can use a BYTE variable to store, retrieve, or update the contents of a
BYTE database column, or to reference a file that you wish to display to users of
the 4GL program through an external editor. After you declare a BYTE data
type, you must use the LOCATE statement to specify the storage location.
