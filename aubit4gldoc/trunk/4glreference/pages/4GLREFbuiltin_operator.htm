</B>An operator which is part of the 4GL language. Built-in operators are keywords
that perform special tasks. They differ from built-in functions in that they
cannot be invoked with the CALL statement and they cannot be called from a C
function. Examples of built-in operators are: ASCII, CURRENT, DATE, and TODAY.
