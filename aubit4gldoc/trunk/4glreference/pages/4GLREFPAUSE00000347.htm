<P></P>
</B>The PAUSE statement temporarily suspends screen output from a 4GL report,
until the user chooses the Resume option at the Report window. The PAUSE statement
can only appear in the <A HREF="4GLREFFORMAT_Section.htm">FORMAT section</A> of a REPORT routine.

<B>string</B>  is a quoted string. (This specification has no effect on Windows systems, but
is supported for compatibility with INFORMIX-4GL for character environments.)
<P></P>
Unless the START REPORT statement or the <A HREF="4GLREFOUTPUT_Section.htm">OUTPUT section</A>  specifies a destination for report output, output is sent by default to the
Report window. The PAUSE statement can be executed only if the report sends its
output to the Report window. It has no effect if you include a TO clause in
the OUTPUT section of the <A HREF="4GLREFINFORMIX4GL_Reports_Overview.htm#a6b7b6cf">REPORT definition</A>, or in the START REPORT statement of the <A HREF="4GLREFINFORMIX4GL_Reports_Overview.htm#804c3110">report driver</A>.
<P></P>
<B>The presence or absence of the PAUSE statement affects the Report window:
<P></P>
</B>In the absence of a PAUSE statement, the Report window is modeless, like the
Help window; the user has simultaneous access to all windows.
<P></P>
In the presence of a PAUSE statement, the Report window becomes modal, taking
exclusive control of the 4GL application until the user dismisses it. The user
can dismiss the Report window by choosing Resume from its menu.
<P></P>
The Report window does not display the string message that PAUSE displays in a
character window.
<P></P>
Your users should be advised that an application can appear suspended if the
user closes a modal Report window by using the System menu button on the Report
window frame, rather than by choosing the Resume menu option.
