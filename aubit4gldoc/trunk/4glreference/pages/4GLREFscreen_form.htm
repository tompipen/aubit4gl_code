<B>screen form
<P></P>
</B>A data entry form displayed in a 4GL window (or the Application window itself)
and used to support input or output tasks in a 4GL application. A screen form
is defined in a form specification file. Before a 4GL program can use a screen
form, this file must first be compiled. The form in the current 4GL window is
called the current form. Most user interaction statements use a screen form for
their input and output.
