<B>OUTPUT Section
<P></P>
</B>The OUTPUT section is an optional section that can specify the number of lines
on each page of report output and the size of the margins. Without the OUTPUT
section, INFORMIX-4GL uses default values to format each page. 
<P></P>

<P></P>
<B>command </B>is a quoted string, specifying a program, shell script, or command line to
receive the output from the report.
<P></P>
<B>filename </B>is a quoted string, specifying the name of a file to receive the report
output. The filename can also include a path name.
<P></P>
<B>size </B>is a literal integer that specifies the vertical height of the page or the top
or bottom margin (in lines), or the horizontal width of the left or right
margin (in character positions).
<P></P>
<B>string </B>is a quoted string, specifying the page-eject character sequence.
<P></P>
<B><UL><LI>ariable </B>is the name of a CHAR or VARCHAR variable that contains a shell script or
command line to receive the output from the report.
<P></P>
</UL>This section can direct the output from the report to a file or to a printer
as the default output destination.
<P></P>
<B>Sending Report Output to a Pipe
<P></P>
</B>The specification after the PIPE keyword must return the name of a program,
shell script, or command line that is to receive the report output. This can also
include command line arguments.
<P></P>
The REPORT TO PIPE option can direct the output to a program that sends the
output to the correct printer, or to some other process. The pipe feature is
supported under Windows by writing to a temporary file GXRPT.TMP in the current
working directory. Once the report is complete, this file is automatically
deleted. Since no other window can be active during execution of a report that
specifies REPORT TO PIPE, there is no possibility of competition for this temporary
file between two 4GL applications.
<P></P>
<B>Sending Report Output to a Printer
<P></P>
</B>If you specify REPORT TO PRINTER, INFORMIX-4GL sends the report to the Print
Manager. 
<P></P>
(INFORMIX-4GL on UNIX uses the DBPRINT environment variable to specify a
default printer. On Windows systems, 4GL produces printed output through the Print
Manager and ignores the value of the DBPRINT environment variable.)
<P></P>
<B>Sending Report Output to a File
<P></P>
</B>Use the REPORT TO &quot;filename&quot; option to send output to a file. You can then
send the file to a printer of your choice. If filename is stored in a program
variable, you must pass that variable as an argument to the REPORT routine in the
argument list.
<P></P>
<B>Sending Report Output to the Report Window
<P></P>
</B>If both the REPORT TO clause and the TO clause of the START REPORT statement
are omitted, output is directed to the Report window. 4GL reports are generated
in <A HREF="4GLREFASCII00000025.htm">ASCII</A> characters for output to files or printers, but 4GL changes the way they are
displayed on the screen. The Report window is a persistent GUI window that
appears when the report is completely assembled and ready for viewing. 
<P></P>
The Report window is controlled by the GUI window manager. It has no mouse
bar, but it does have a 4GL ring menu with Next, Previous, and Resume options.
Rather than prompt the user for a RETURN at the end of a screen, the Report window
highlights the Next option and waits for the user to click that option or
press RETURN.
