</B><OL><LI> In the INFORMIX-4GL Interactive Debugger, an alias assigns a new command name
or function key to some debugging action. The action can consist of existing
debugging commands and aliases. Aliases are a convenient mechanism for executing
a specific variant of a command or a list of commands.

<OL START="2"><LI> In the database, an alias is a synonym for a table name. It immediately
follows the name of the table in an SQL statement. It can be used wherever the name
of a table can be used. Aliases are often used to create short, readable names
for long or external table names.
