<B>built-in function
<P></P>
</B>A function which is part of the 4GL language and can therefore be called from
a calling routine without needing to be defined by the developer. Function
calls for built-in functions have the same syntax as those for programmer-defined
functions. Examples of built-in functions are: ARG_VAL( ), ARR_CURR( ),
FGL_KEYVAL( ), and SCR_LINE( ).
