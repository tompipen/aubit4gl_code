</B><OL><LI> Run a compiled or interpreted program by carrying out the instructions in an
executable file. To execute or run a program, the operating system must create
a process for the program and then allocate the CPU (and any other resources
needed by the program) to this process. The state of the program in execution is
often called run time.

<OL START="2"><LI> A 4GL executable file contains either interpreted p-code or compiled C code.
Compiled C programs are executable in and of themselves; they can be run at the
command line. Interpreted programs (p-code) require the use of a system
program called a runner, the P-code Runner.
