</B>A one-to-one correspondence between entities in two domains. The association
between an identifier and its resource (a location in memory) is called a
binding. In 4GL, the correspondence between form fields and program variables during
data entry is also called a binding. Several 4GL user interaction statements
include a binding clause that lists the names of accept user input from a form
field and program variables and their corresponding form fields (or database
columns). These statements include CONSTRUCT, INPUT, INPUT ARRAY, and PROMPT.
