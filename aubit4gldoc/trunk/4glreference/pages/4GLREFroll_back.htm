</B>Terminate a transaction by undoing any changes to the database since the
beginning of the transaction. The database is restored to the state that existed
before the transaction began. When the transaction is rolled back, all open
database cursors (except hold cursors) are closed and all locks are released. The
ROLLBACK WORK statement rolls back the current transaction.
