<B>process
<P></P>
</B>An independent unit of operating system execution. It keeps track of the state
of execution for a program. The operating system creates a process for each
program being executed. It allocates resources needed by a program (memory, disk,
CPU) to its process. The current process is the one which has been allocated
use of the CPU. A 4GL application usually runs with two processes: the 4GL
application (the front end) and a database engine (the back end).
