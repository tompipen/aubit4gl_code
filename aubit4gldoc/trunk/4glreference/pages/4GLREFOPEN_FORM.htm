<B>filename</B> is a quoted string that specifies the name of a file that contains the
compiled screen form. This can also include a pathname.
<P></P>
<B>form </B> is a 4GL identifier that you assign here as the name of the form.
<P></P>
<B>To display a form, you can follow these steps:
<P></P>
</B><OL><LI> Create a form specification file. (This file should have a .PER extension.)
<P></P>
<LI> Compile the form by using the Form Compiler. (The compiled form file has .FRM
as its file extension.)
<P></P>
<LI> Declare the form name by using the OPEN FORM statement.
<P></P>
<LI> Display the form by using the DISPLAY FORM statement.
<P></P>
</OL>Once 4GL displays the form, you can activate the form by executing the
CONSTRUCT, DISPLAY ARRAY, or INPUT statements.
<P></P>
When it executes the OPEN FORM statement, 4GL loads the compiled form into
memory. (The CLOSE FORM statement is a memory-management feature to recover memory
from forms that the program no longer displays on the screen.)
