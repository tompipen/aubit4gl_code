</B>To prepare something for use. In programming, opening something often entails
allocating memory and other resources to it, and sometimes means getting
exclusive access. Typically, things cannot be used until they have been opened; then
they remain usable until they are closed. To open a cursor means to have the
database engine process the query up to the point of locating the first selected
row; this can entail significant processing and space in memory and on disk. To
open a file is to locate the file and bring it into memory. To open a form is
to find the compiled form file, bring it into memory, and prepare to display
it. To open a 4GL window is to allocate memory for the image of the window, push
it onto the window stack, and to display it on the screen.
