<H2> Principios
</H2>
<P> The applications normally have three types of documents:
structural and manual specifications, documents for the users.
</P>
<P> The scope of this document is arrested only with the
documents that describe the applications structurally.
</P>
<P> Documentation created in autonomous documents normally is 
desactualizados and modified only when the management defines it as 
with priority task (what its f&#244;r state only happens when such that 
already does not have any utility). 
</P>
<P> Of this form we think that the best form will be the
documentation to be the position of the programmers and preference
next to the code that if is to register (or either in source of 4gl).

</P>
<P> Therefore, the example of javadoc we decide to perfectly
create a definite tool that on the basis of standards very defined
well extracts the information absorbed in the code and generates
documents with format specifies and.
</P>
<P> We must therefore try to follow the following principios:
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B> The structural documentation is defined under the form of
commentaries of documentation written in the code marked source and
some documents as acessiveis specifications of these documents.
</B></P>
	<LI><P><B> References the alterations efectuadas in determined version
must be kept in the system of control of versions.
</B></P>
</UL>
<H3> Who is &quot; ' the owner ' of the commentaries of documentation -
Especificadores, documentors or programmers
</H3>
<P> The commentaries do not have to be of the exclusive
responsibility of none of these entities.  This is partilhada between
them consonant the phase where projecto if finds,
</P>
<P> It is important to notice that to a large extent of the
projectos, the programs source are inherited already construidos and
many times not registered.  Of any form, of certainty they are not
registered with the nomenclature that we use.
</P>
<P> Ideally the documentation must be written by the programmers
to the measure who implement (or they modify) the functions.  If to
exist a methodology of initial writing of a skeleton being later each
function implemented for the programmers, must be the responsible one
for the construction of the skeleton to write it.
</P>
<P> When this documentation is initiated already after the
application being in functioning (in a process of refactoring or
simply of documentation), must be efectuada under the form of taken
over on a contract basis tentanto to the maximum that is most
exhausting possivel.
</P>
<P> After the inserted documentation, during the phase of
maintenance of projecto, the programmers have to modify all the
documentation in that he relates to the efectuadas modifications.  In
the case of resolution of bug(s) these must be registadas in the
control of versions.
</P>
<P> With this in mind, these principios try to describe the 
commentaries for documentation.  They must be understood as 
suggestions instead of rigidos requirements to follow until the a 
exhaustion.  That they always exist alternative creative that if it 
proves to be more efficient must aplic&#225;as and exactly sugeriz them it 
the responsible one of this document.

<H2> Terminology
</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2.01cm"><B> Commentaries for documentation </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> (doc comments)
</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 4.01cm; font-weight: medium"> Commentaries special written in the code source of 4gl
delimited by { * *... }. These commentaries are processed by the tool
p4gl to paracarregar the documentation in a relationary database.
Developed in flex (lex), bison (yacc), C and Perl.
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2.01cm"><B> fgldoc
</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 4.01cm; font-weight: medium"> The tool that dynamically generates the documentation from
the loaded data in the repository in relationary format.  It was
developed in jsp and it java.
</P>
<H2> Filing-cabinets Source
</H2>
<P> The tool generates documentation with origin in some sources:

</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P> Programs source in language 4gl.
</P>
	<LI><P> Documents of description of processes.
</P>
	<LI><P> Documents of description of packages.
</P>
</UL>
<H2> General form of a documentation commentary
</H2>
<P> A documentation commentary is made in two parts:  a followed 
description of zero or more tags, with a blank string between these 
sec&#231;&#245;es:
</P>
<TABLE WIDTH=100% BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=4 CELLSPACING=3>
	<COL WIDTH=256*>
	<THEAD>
		<TR>
			<TD WIDTH=100% VALIGN=TOP>
				<PRE> { * * That is the part of the description of the
documentation commentary

@process SUBSCRIBERS }
</PRE>
			</TD>
		</TR>
	</THEAD>
</TABLE>
<UL>
	<LI><P> The first string is indentada by form to be lined up with the
code that follows the commentary and starts with simbolo of
beginning-of-commentary ({**) followed of one return.
</P>
	<LI><P> The following strings start with a asteristico * or only with
a space.  When to exist, the asteristico is removed and substituido by
a space.
</P>
	<LI><P> A string of blank commentary between the description and the
stack of tags must be inserted such as above it is presented.
</P>
	<LI><P> To insert strings blank between related tablets of tags
</P>
	<LI><P> It finishes it string starts with simbolo of
end-of-commentary (}) followed of one return.
</P>
</UL>
<P> Strings with more than 80 characters of size must, if
possivel duly to be left.  If it will more than have a paragraph in
the documentation commentary, separates the paragraph with tag
&lt; P &gt;.
</P>
<H2> Descriptions

<P STYLE="margin-left: 2.01cm"><B> First phrase
</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2.01cm"> The first phrase of each commentary of documentation must be
a summary, contends a concise but full description of the item that is
to be registered.  The tool javadoc copies this first phrase for the
relative summary of the item.  This becomes important the writing of
informaticas initial phrases that if obtains to describe immediately.

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2.01cm"> This phrase finishes in the first point (.) followed of a
space, tab or end of string or in first tag found.  In the example
that if follows the first phrase finishes in Prof.:
