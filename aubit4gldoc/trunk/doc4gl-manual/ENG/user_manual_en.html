<h2> Introduction </h2>
           During the life cycle of a project, the documentation that associates  
 to the implementation (in 4gl code) to functionality it becomes rapidly unsynchronized.<br> 
        <br>
           This fact occurs due to form and place where this normally is 
stored.    <br>
        <br>
   The designer usualy to construct a document where it arrives for times  
at  the detail to define the functions, its return values and parameters.  
<br>
        <br>
           Is common to use CASE tools as the Power Designer putting inside  
 of the processes definition the documentation descriptions of the program  
 to be built. <br> 
          <br>
           In the initial phase of project development (if the manager have  
 some carefull), it is probable that the documentation reflects the programmed  
 code. <br>
          <br>
           When dumb for a phase of the process most advanced, normally immediately  
 after the first usable version, the chaos starts.  The programmer has to  
decide and the tracker does not have time to control everything.  Thus the  
source code gets modified, but as the programmer for definition does not like 
to modify documents this is immediately unsynchronized. <br> 
          <br>
           The more time passes more unsynchronized it is.  Until it does  
not  serve for nothing. <br> 
          <br>
           It would be easy to blame the programmers, however the documentation  
 normally is hidden underneath of some server, in a obscure directory inside  
 a document (normally in .doc format ) normally with sets of ten of pages.  
  The context change is such that of fact me does not seem easy of it to demand 
 similar effort. <br> 
          <br>
           The aproaches initiated with some work, as for example <i> literate  
 programming </i>  are in this market each time more used. <br> 
          <br>
           The Java is paradigmathic:  The reference documentation of all  
API(s)  is gotten by automatic processes with information contained in sources.  
<br>
          <br>
           With this form, we easily note the existence of clear improvements,  
 as for example: <br> 
                   
<blockquote>                              
  <ul>
              <li>Unique  tool used for programming and reference documentating  
 (text editor, usually vi or emacs). </li> 
              <li> Easy visualization of documentation errors. </li>
              <li> Increased productivity. </li>
              <li> More communication inside of programming teams (given
that  all the functions will be registered, being this easily available).
      <br>
              </li>
                                       
  </ul>
            </blockquote>
            <br>
           This tool gives 4gl what already it exists in java it (with javadoc)  
 or in the C/C++ (with projects as doxygen), or either:  <br> 
                                       
  <blockquote>                                                  
    <ul>
                <li> The possibility of the reference documentation to be 
incluided  in the source 4gl modules. </li>
                <li>Generation of reference documentation in readable format.</li>
                <li> Possibility of search. </li>
                <li> Reference documents with diverse organizations. </li>
                                                           
    </ul>
   Obviously, however the programmers and project managers have to create  
some  discipline to allow that during the modifications to the programs, the 
documents  are modified to.  Inclusively he must yourself define <a href="http://world.altavista.com/sites/nzen/pos/babelfish/urltrurl?lp=pt_en&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.despodata.pt%2FFglDocumenter%2FfgldocGuidelines.html">

    <h1><small> For the impacient </small></h1>
         Not to compel to the full reading of the manual some tipical sequences  
 for installation and execution of the tool are presented here. <br> 
         <br>
                             
    <h2> Compilation </h2>
     The components that need compilation are:  the parser (p4gl) and aditional  
 classes of the manager.<br> 
        <br>
     To compile just execute <i> make </i>  in the base directorythe tool. 
     <br>
                             
    <h2> Installation </h2>
     Execute <i> make install </i>. <br> 
                             
    <h2> Execution </h2>
      One presents only tipical examples of execution with non graphical 
User  Interface, called Command line User Interface (CUI).<br>

      This executable is, under the point of view fgldocumenter tool, the 
most important part.  When a project  will be well organized  and structured, 
the functional documentation wil being made by the  programmers in each source 
program and loaded to the repository using this  tool. <br> 
                                        <br>
The parser is implemented with the reserved word limitation such as great 
part of 4gl(s) compilers existing (except  of Informix and 4js).<br> 
                                      <br>
This way, the sources  loaded informs should not contain reserved words as 
name of identifiers (example: you cant using <i>display</i> as variable name). 
                                      <br>
                                        <br>
      If such to occur and you even intend to load the information of these 
programs, it can be used one special  comment   that, when inserted makes 
that  that parser ignores the 4gl code inserted between it. This  special 
comment is  {IGNORE } and ignores the code until it finds a new  equal comment. 
                                      <br>
                                        <br>
      When if to try to load the information  with these reserved words without 
without special  IGNORE comment, the parser alert to the existence of a  syntax 
error.. <br>

                                      <h1>Documentation refactoring cycle</h1>
The goal of development of this tool was the need of knowing "something" 
about 4gl projects to make some refactoring in that code.<br> 
                                      <br>
So, we gain some experience with this kind of processes-<br> 
                                        <br>
        Thus, given the caracteristicas of the tool we can say that this 
 allows us to document a 4gl projecto in an iterative and evolutive form. 
                                      <br>
                                        <br>
        Such happens beacause its possible to do imports and exports in both 
ways with severall information formats allowing to modify it in this formats 
and loaded again  (CSV, RDBMS, 4gl) being able to be converted for another 
format (with the exception of the generated HTML that is unidireccional).  
                                      <br>

                            Thus, we think that to document a 4gl project 
we could follow the steps: <br>

If we are starting with a new 4gl project, the team should be duly formed 
to insert the fgldoc comments during the program work.<br> 
                                        <br>
      Thus, is prevented unnecessary refactorings and the easiness of maintenance 
is maginified.<br> 
                                          <br>
      If used the stack of todo tasks for carrying through, can be an important 
 aid in the stream / program process, given that the programmer can  register 
in the sources that he is  writing (without necessity change to other environment)  
which the tasks that is leaving for later implementing (therefore during the 
development our mind are gone remembering details that we can not implement 
at that time because we are implementing another functionality).   <br>
