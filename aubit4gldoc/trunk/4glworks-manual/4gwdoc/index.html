4glWorks is an application framework that greatly simplifies Informix
4gl application development 

<H2><B>Application framework?!</B></H2>

<P>4glWorks is a working application that can be used as a starting point
to develop new applications. The basic idea is that you don't have to
write from scratch code that uses tools from a library.</P>

<P>
You have a working skeleton that you can extend by adding new modules
that interact with the existing code in a standardized way: by exchanging
messages.</P>

<H3><B>Message driven?!</B></H3>

<P>In a 4glWorks application, different modules interact by exchanging <I>messages</I>
in a way similar (but much simpler in design) to event driven systems.</P>

<P>
Hopefully, you will not have to change a single line of the existing code.
If a module doesn't exactly do what you want, chances are that you can
extend its behavior by adding a new module that <I>filters</I> the messages
between the old module &amp; the rest of your application. Encapsulation
&amp; Inheritance.</P>

<H3><B>Object Oriented?!</B></H3>

<P>Oh, no! This is 4gl! And apart from that, I have never done any serious
OO programming. Nonetheless, 4glWorks design was influenced by existing
event driven OOP tools.</P>

<H3><B>Compact</B></H3>

<P>Applications developed with 4glWorks tend to be smaller in size that if
developed the "traditional" 4gl way, while being more flexible in use.</P>
