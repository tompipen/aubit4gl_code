<p align="left"><i><u>What is it?</u></i></p>
<p align="left">Long time ago, Informix made a Fourth Generation Language (4GL),
called Informix 4GL. It was intended to be nice language for making business
process, database oriented programming easy and productive. Some people agreed
with this, and started making applications in that language. And over the time,
they made a lot of 4gl applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">In the process, a lot of programmers find it easy to use,
stabile, fast, easy to manage, and most of all, productive. So the number of
people with I-4GL skills continued growing. But, Informix was slow to respond to
increased demand for feature enhancements, most notably, GUI, or reacted in a
way that was not well accepted by users, like making a completely new product
with limited 4GL compatibility, called New Era.</p>
<p align="left">Several companies seized the opportunity, and started making
compatible compilers, and extending functionality. And Informix 4GL was no
longer in hands of one company, competition increased, feature where added at
increasing pace, and this is where we are now.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Aubit 4GL project is a project to make free, GPL, OpenSource,
Informix-4GL compatible compiler, and continue to extend functionality needed to
write most efficient, stabile and productive applications in business related,
database oriented applications.</p>
<p align="left"><u><i>Why is it?</i></u></p>
<p align="left">It is, because despite increasing number of commercial I-4GL
compiler makers, Informix professionals was increasingly frustrated by lack of
mainly professional and timely support from most of commercial vendors.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">It is, because we discovered advantages of OpenSource model
development using other OpenSource software needed to make things work in our
daily work, and the disadvantages in getting our job done, when having to
literally beg on our knees for anything that we need from commercial companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">It is, because Internet enabled us to share not only knowledge,
but provide a way for us to work together over it, using version control tools
like CVS, change control tools like Keystone, and discussion tools like Phorum.</p>
<p align="left">It it, because we believe in it, since trough all this years, we
have yet to discover more productive ways to make database oriented business
applications.</p>

<p>The application compiler generates ANSI-C code which you will need a
C-compiler in order to compile. The libraries are currently only generated/verified
to work for GNU C for Windows (GNU C-Win32 which is available free from <a href="http://www.cygnus.com">Cygnus
Software</a>) and GNU C for Linux.</p>
<h3>Not implemented
</h3>

<p>
Input array is currently considered BETA code. It works, there is an option 'NO NEW LINES', but the
color attributes are
not working yet.
</p>

<p>
eg.
</p>

<p>
input array aa from srec1.* attribute(NO NEW LINES,CYAN)<br>
NO NEW LINES should work, CYAN will not...
</p>

<p>
 attributes are not used from the input array statement.
</p>

<p>
Null's as passed parameters in SQL  (Keyword is OK but not variables)
</p>

<p>
Interrupt key may not work properly
</p>

<p>
Some memory leaks
</p>

<p>
some EXIT .... are not fully implemented
</p>

<p>
OpenLink ODBC has no SQLExtendedFetch which is required for Scroll Cursors.
</p>

<p>
wordwrap does not work properly
</p>

<p>
not all .h files in the include directory are used/required&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
DBDATE works only in dmy mode at the moment.
</p>

<p>
problem with include= in form fixed (still no include=null)
</p>

<p>
 quite a few errors with datetime/interval datatypes - these are still experimental. '+ 2 units months' is not currently supported.
(It will be - its just not yet)
</p>

<p>
I don't think insert cursors are coded either - so PUT won't work yet either.
</p>

<p>
LET variable = -something - known problem - no fix yet.	workaround : LET variable = 0 - something
</p>

<p>
 if pa_prodinfo[idx].info_ind not matches'[1234]' - needs a space between matches and '[..]'
