Necessary Files:
Makefile
aubman.lyx

Prerequisite packages:
latex (with package lmodern if you want handsome PDF)
lyx (v 1.3.4 or later)
latex2html to produce HTML. 

There is a long-standing bug in latex2html which results in stunted tables.
To test whether your distro has this problem, use LyX to create a small table
in a new document within a section and subsection. 

If only the 1st row of the table appears when you invoke the
View->HTML option, then you need to fix /usr/bin/latex2html.

Fortunately the fix is trivial: Just add the statement: $within_preamble=0;
before the closing brace before
 print " $replacements new-command replacements\n";

The file latex2html is a shell script which calls a whole bunch of perl stuff
in a lib directory to do the latex to HTML conversion.

To install the Aubit4GL manual:

 untar the package into a directory. e.g.
   mkdir /opt/aubit/4gldoc
   cd /opt/aubit/4gldoc
   tar xvfz /path/to/tarball/aubman.tar.gz
   make
