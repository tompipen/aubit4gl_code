<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">Q:</span>  <a name="I'm compiling a 4GL program using fglc, not fglpc, and I see this messages:"> I'm compiling a 4GL program
using fglc, not fglpc, and I see this messages:</a>

<blockquote>
<p>4glc hello.4gl<br>
 Start state attribute 1<br>
 Start state attribute 0<br>
 Start state attribute 1<br>
 Start state attribute 0
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are they?
</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">A:</span> As for the 'Start state's have a look in the states.c file (probably in
4glc/generated or 4glc/rules/generated)
They should not be printed in user versions and were for me during
development of the compiler....
</p>
<p> The 'states' messages are there because of the menu command - which invokes the states for control keys (eg. f1, f2, control-x etc).
Its about the lexer, take the following
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
define f1 integer			(1)<br>
menu<br>
	command key(f1) ...	(2)<br>
..
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
in (2) f1 should be function-key-f1, in (1) it should be a variable name.
</p>
<p>
States are when certain keywords can be accepted. so there is a 'state' for
command keys etc.
The messages shouldn't be printed though...

<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">Q: </span><a name="Can I use Aubit compiled program as CGI for my web server?">Can I use Aubit compiled
program as CGI for my web server?</a></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">A:&nbsp;</span> Yes. But, there's the bit about taking input from a page into 4gl
variables.There is also a small matter of invoking 4gl program from WWW server. How do you make program execute when you put URL,
say, <a href="http://www.falout.com/cgi-bin/myprog"> www.falout.com/cgi-bin/myprog</a>
when myprog is Aubit 4gl compiled code, like your HTML example, and get page displayed in your browser?</p>
<p> If you cannot take input, how different is this from executing the same 4gl code in any other 4gl compiler?</p>
<p>You can invoke you normally by putting it in your cgi bin directory exactly as
you say, using the NOCURSES bit disables all the screen setup control codes (eg. clear screen, move curses to top left, etc etc).</p>
<p>How would that call look?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.falout.com/cgi-bin/myprog?NOCOURSES=1?param3?param3">www.falout.com/cgi-bin/myprog?NOCOURSES=1?param3?param3</a></p>
<p>If I was using it in a CGI mode - I'd probably have a shell script wrapper than passing the NOCURSES in the CGI call:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>#!/bin/sh<br>
	cat - | my4glprog NOCURSES= $@</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(or something similar anyway)</p>
<p>Pity it would not attempt to output regular screen interactions as HTML, but that would probably not make sense anyway since HTML is page
oriented, so no action before you submit the whole page... Try 4Js CLI-HTML or Querix HTML stuff.</p>
<p>The other difference between this and other 4gls doing the same thing is that
you can embed C code into your own to do virtually anything you want, look at example for that 'list' function - try doing that in
4gl.</p>
<p>The input should be simple too, I'll have a look later at implementing the reading for GET and POST and see what I can
find. I was only using this as an example - but it could be useful to provide a fuller example..!</p>
<p> For existing 4gl code it simply does not make sense. The fact that you must operate on the page, not
field level, is forcing rewrite of most user interaction logic, so about 30 % of code at least. And it's not easy, and it breaks
compatibility. If you write from scratch, then you now have tools like PHP, that are simply FANTASTIC for this task.</p>
<p>Maybe you should forget this HTML stuff for anything but reports. In reports, as Querix is doing, HTML output is really cool.</p>
<p>And after all, HTML is/was designed to be static, and reports are static. Otherwise, I see XML and/or JavaScript as OK for interaction,
but I really fell we need real Java applet to run presentation logic for real field level operations, like lookup, pop-up windows, input
validation with sub-queries after input on field level, etc...&nbsp;</p>
<p>But CGI can be complicated, it may be quite easy to write a little library to help the novice do this in 4GL rather than C or shell scripts directly.
I repeat - No screen interactions (ie any thing needing keypresses)- these are in fact prohibited in this
mode.</p>
<p>Heres an example that could be used for generating HTML pages...</p>

NCURESES, and what
is it used for in Aubit 4GL?</a></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">A: </span>The ncurses (new curses) library is a freeware emulation of
System V Release 4.0 curses. It uses terminfo format, supports pads and color and multiple
highlights and forms characters and function-key mapping, and has all the other
SYSV-curses enhancements over BSD curses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The NOCURSES parameter (see CGI) is just plain ASCII text of what your program outputs, no other
controls sent..</p>
<p>One other thing that might be of interest (as I alluded to before) is the NOCURSES option, this suppresses the calls to the curses
library.</p>
<p>I agree that NOCURSES making no sense for existing 4GL applications, it not meant for that,
ever tried piping a 4gl through another program ?</p>
<p>	test.4ge | wc</p>
<p>There are all sorts of ^[[A23 type stuff in there meant to move the cursor around and set
colors and stuff.</p>
<p>The windows version of ncurses is called 'pdcurses' which does not implement this call - so if WIN32 is defined (ie. your compiling under windows 95)
then it makes one up.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">Q: </span> at the moment, Aubit compiler is usable only with Informix engines,

<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">A: </span> You can use it with any engine provided&nbsp;</p>
<p>	1) You use informix syntax (which most other SQLs recognise except for 'outer')</p>
<p>	2) or you prepare it first (in which case the 4gl doesnt interpret the SQL and passes it straight back into ODBC</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">Q: </span> Because of this, it does not make sense to force people to install
OpenLink, which is not really easy anyway, since they will need to install some informix engine, and then they can install CSDK easily,
maybe even RPM's, that will include CLI ODBC.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">A:</span> It shouldn't be limited to just informix, but it should be easy to set up both
ICDK, and IODBC.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">Q:</span> there is no way currently to take -liodbc from LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and
all libraries MUST physically be in $AUBITDIR/extlibs, and this directory name is hard-coded (extlibs), and there is no environment
variable, that can change this.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">A: </span> Correct at time of going to press, the ODBC_LIB_DIR should be implemented in
the 4glpc program...</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">Q: </span> Since there is no library called libiodbc in Informix
CSDK/CLI, compiling the compiler using provided make files is possible using OpenLink only.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">A: </span> Quite possibly - I'll investigate - I *have* compiled against the SDK
previously..</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">Q: </span> You have mentioned that you did use Informix ODBC. Can you please
describe.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">A: </span> I'll try to do it again and let you know how I did it.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">Q: </span> I'm confused with the fact that the ODBC driver is linked into
compiler. Or is this just Iodbc manager? Can you choose actual driver in
runtime/compiletime, without re-compiling compiler?&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">A: </span> Its just the manager for iODBC/Openlink, for Informix its the actual driver..
If you compile in a driver manager, yes you can swap and change, I have had connections to two different
RDBMS s concurrently doing this..&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have written a couple of ODBC drivers myself - maybe bundling one of them is a good
idea. One doesn't even connect to a database, but connects to a file, eg</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>	select owner,modified_date,dir_name,file_name from '/tmp/myfile'<br>
  <br>
	owner 		mike<br>
	modified_date	1/1/2000<br>
	dir_name /tmp<br>
	file_name	myfile</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>	select file_name  from '/tmp' where size>1000<br>
  <br>
	file_name	myfile<br>
	file_name	myfile2<br>
	filename	coredump</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">Q: </span>What choices I have for
ODBC manager, when linking compiler?</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">A:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.unixodbc.org">http://www.unixodbc.org</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.iodbc.org">http://www.iodbc.org</a></p>
<p>As far as I know - the ODBC manager should present a common interface to Aubit
4GL, whether that manager is unixODBC or iODBC.</p>
<p>But in that case, one would ask, why did I need to have iODBC /lib dir present when&nbsp;
compiling? If I understand correctly, only header file should be enough to compile?
Not quite - you'll get link errors without the library.</p>
<p>NOTE :It may use some different header files to iODBC (in the same way the iODBC uses different header files to Win32 MS-ODBC)</p>
<p>Normally only the names of the files change so you can just #ifdef around them.
Filename is maybe different, but any ODBC .h defining interface should be OK- as far as I can tell...</p>
<p>But in that case, if you compile with iODBC header, you cannot use compiler with unixODBC manager
until you recompile the compiler? It is not maybe tragic for compiler, but you also need to recompile all
programs, if you need to change ODBC driver. Bit of a git this isn't it ?!</p>
<p>Remember though that unixODBC is specific in some areas (GUI tools) at the last count. It is not as portable as
iODBC, and is most definitely harder to compile</p>
<p>From the iodbc mailing list  (June '99):<br>
Peter Harvey wrote:</p>
<p>The focus for iODBC is clearly the DM and platform portability while unixODBC is broader in scope with less focus on portability. My feeling is
that this *was* a great problem when unixODBC started out but is not much of an issue anymore. Its not an issue anymore because most of unixODBC goals
have been achieved, or are on the verge of being achieved, on Linux and so now portability is more in the focus of unixODBC. The extra tools in
unixODBC (ODBCConfig, DataManager), the code template, the driver helper libs, and some sample drivers are still important but does not negate the
use of a common DM.</p>

<p>Now, you compare them, and say: Bugger, if I use unixODBC on Xenix, I will not have GUI configuration, templates, etc, so
I'll rather use iODBC and not have them anyway, because of ...Also, GUI part is really
no longer issue after qt was ported left and right.</p>
<p>The most important reason for me to look at unixODBC is GUI management. As you would probably agree, people
exhibit extraordinary ability to mess up ODBC config files, put them in all the wrong places, etc.</p>
<p>Then again, there in mot much reason not to take just that out of unixODBC and use it with iODBC. Or
not.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">Q:&nbsp;</span> Do I even need to link compiler with any manager, after all, .so
is for Shared Object?</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">A:</span> Yes - it needs to resolve them before it can call them.
Otherwise a4gl would have to act like a driver manager. Would that be a right thing to do in the future?</p>
<p>No it would mean incorporating an extra ODBC level, adding (say) iODBC into Aubit 4G, to then call an iODBC manager or the unixODBC manager. or the
Informix CLI.</p>
<p>Interestingly - I beleive that an ODBC manager can call another ODBC manager as if it was an ODBC driver, so you could link against iODBC, point
that to the unixODBC driver which then points to a data source - bit messy though !</p>
<p> We could include iODBC in a4gl distribution, but that would slow things down if we didnt need it ...</p>
<p>Best off posting to the iODBC (freeODBC) mailing list for general help - we are
not just talking iODBC and unixODBC. Now that iODBC is GPL - there could be any number of possible DM (data source managers..).</p>
<p>Its an interesting problem - but I dont think the answer is to add an ODBC manager into 4GL directly - you would gain nothing to having it statically
linked.</p>
<p>I agree that there is a good chance that unixODBC is the way to go - but all the openlink drivers (for anything other than non-GPL dBs your probably going
to be using these) use iODBC, i beleive you said that the informix CLI now uses iODBC too.</p>
<p>With that in mind its probably best keeping things as they are - You can link
the 4gl compiler and the resulting codes against one or other at compile time (at the very least - it may also be possible to fudge the shared libraries
around) I doubt that in most cases this would be a problem.</p>
<p>The only other consideration is that a4gl always used version 2.0 -> 2.5 (?) of ODBC. iODBC and unixODBC are now 3.0 -> 3.5 compatible - it may be that the
way I'm doing things is not the most efficient....</p>

<p>Informix still needs a .odbc.ini file - so it should be possible to connect to any datasource from the Informix CLI
and vice versa  (making previous discussions about ODBC managers pretty irrelevant!)</p>
<p>my .odbc.ini file:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[ODBC Data Sources]<br>
  Informix7=Informix 7.x ODBC Driver<br>
  ;<br>
  ; Define ODBC Database Driver's Below - Driver Configuration Section<br>
  ;<br>
  <br>
  [Informix7]<br>
  Driver=/disks/disk1/informix/lib/cli/iclis09a.so<br>
  Description=Informix 7.x ODBC Driver<br>

  LogonID=informix<br>
  pwd=informix<br>
  Service=sqids7<br>
  Protocol=onsoctcp<br>

</blockquote>
<p>So, you can link a4gl to CLI, and connect to PostgreSQL, just by defining a section in
.odbc.ini, although I have not tested this.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">A: </span>One thing I would like to add would be threads - but that starts getting
complicated because of the 4GL stack.</p>
<p>Jonathan Lefller once posted some discussion about this, and I think it looked not-so-tragic-but-not-trivial. I think he's main problem was
ESQL/C at the time, but they are treaded now, and we don't need them anyway.</p>
<p>The main problem as far as we are conserned is our 4gl stack which expects to
be linear, if you have threading, each thread must use a different stack.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">A:</span> I added all the hooks one could think of - it shouldn't be too
difficult to do.</p>
<p>I did start work on a VB front end - but didn't get very far.</p>
<p>Quick overview - have a look in lib/gui.c &amp; lib/gui_io.c</p>
<p>when the 4gl application starts - the parameters to it are pre-processed before
making them available to arg_val.. There are currently two options</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>NOCURSES=...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>GUIPORT=...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the NOCURSES you just need a value after the equals. For 'guiport' it starts listening at the given service port for a
tcp/ip connection.</p>
<p>eg.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>test1.4gl :<br>
  <br>
	main<br>
	        display "Hello"<br>
	end main</p>
</blockquote>
<p>if you compile this to be test1 then run it</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>	$ ./test1 GUIPORT=2000</p>
</blockquote>
<p>then on another terminal</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>	$ telnet &lt;yourmachine> 2000 		# mine is called 'dax'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>you get something like :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>	bash-2.02# telnet dax 2000<br>
	Trying 192.168.1.7...	# printed by telnet<br>

<p>Also, take a look at WTK (GNU) code&nbsp; from Bruickner &amp; Jarosh</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bj-ig.de/wtk.html">http://www.bj-ig.de/wtk.html</a></p>
<p>Why not take this as front-end to start with, if it was good enough for 4Js?
They made they GUI front-end using this.</p>
<p> There are utilities on www.freshmeat.net which will allow you to proxy this conversation and have a look at
what's being passed. Have a look for 'sniffit' it can generate log files for connections via ports
and has an interactive mode too.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">Q: </span><a name="What is thing called Bison doing with Aubit 4GL?">What is thing called Bison
doing with Aubit 4GL?</a></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">A: </span>Best bet on bison is get a book!
Most Unix programming books will cover it. The user never sees the bison bit - its just for the compiler writers.</p>
<p>The section I posted you looks for 'DEFER INTERRUPT" or "DEFER QUIT" and if it
finds it in the file your compiling it performs the printc actions...</p>
<p>You will not *need* to learn bison, but if you want to modify any of the compiler then you might want to.
Its very straightforward :</p>
<p>A simple example :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>defer_cmd       :       DEFER_INTERRUPT {printc("def_int();");}<br>
                |       DEFER_QUIT {printc("def_quit();");}<br>
                ;<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>printc is part of the aubit4gl library for printing to the generated C file. Having the _cmd is preprocessed by some of my scripts to mean it can be used
anywhere a normal command can.(Eg. sleep_cmd is defined, display_cmd etc.etc)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In directories there may be another 'bin', and/or 'generated' directories 'bin' would contain any scripts used to generate some source code
'generated' would contain any generated source code (ie. wouldn't normally be distributed as part of the source
code)</p>
<p>libincl is a directory that contains all the headers needed to compile the compiler (and the associated library).</p>
<p>If you cd to the lib directory - it should be a directory under there. These are *not* needed by the programs you compile, at the moment the only
header needed by that is '4glhdr.h' (or something similar)</p>

that into use for development CVS repository access</a> at <a href="http://www.falout.com">www.falout.com</a>?</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">A: </span>Unless I open pserver port on my router, no. It is possible, but jCVS client (Java + Swing) is really simple, and it is
using it's own servlet on my server, so the communication is going on http port. At the same time, it will run on Linux, and it is really
easy to work with.</p>
<p>Another option is WinCVS, that is more or less same stuff as jCVS, but it is using pserver, so I would need to open the pserver port.</p>
<p>Since WinCVS is more powerful, you might consider using jCVS just to import files from my server, then work on local files with WinCVS (if
you have a Windows box) and then return stuff to the repository using jCVS.</p>
<p>But I think when you see jCVS client in action, you will see it is really easy, and very good for what we need.</p>
<p>The point is, it took me only few hours to make jCVS client work, and we need to think about other people that will join us too. jCVS is
presenting repositories as tree menu of files, and the GUI was always good for simplifying file oriented tasks.</p>
<p>Reasonably useful manual is included, and if you install JavaHelp (that is also provided as part of client, just make sure it is in the
CLASSPATH), you will get context sensitive help too.</p>

<p>Try:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ man xdr</p>
<p>Its a universal way of storing data which can be read on any platform.&nbsp; Its
normally used for ONC RPC calls, but I've used it to save the form data. In this way, a form compiled under unix can be run under windows without
recompiling it. XDR always converts to the local format.One of the nice things about it is that there is a program called
'rpcgen' which is used to create ONC RPC programs, this takes a definition file ( .x
extension) and compiles a ..._xdr.c file - this handled the loading and saving of data for you. Using this is how I managed to get forms compiled into 'C'
code written so quickly...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fcompile -c formname</p>
<p>generates formname.c which is a dump of the xdr data.</p>
