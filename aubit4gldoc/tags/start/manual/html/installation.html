<p>In theory, you can use any SQL database that have scroll cursor support in
ODBC drivers, but be aware that not all Informix-SQL syntax is supported by all
database engine. Also, you should be able to use any ODBC connection manager
with all ODBC drivers, but I see no reason not to use iODBC. If you successfully
installed Aubit 4GL with other tools, please let us know.

<p><i><u>Installation:</u></i>
</p>

<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">a) </span> Make sure you have all the prerequisites listed at the top of this page!
</p>

<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">b) </span> If you are getting sources via CVS clients check-out function, and create
and select directory like /usr/aubit for checkout, two directories will be
created under /usr/aubit: Aubit4gl and CVS. All directories named CVS are not to
be modified, they are only for CVS control. See more about CVS options on <a href="http://www.falout.com">www.falout.com</a>
under Version Control. If you do not plan to work on compiler source files to be
returned to central repository, you can delete all CVS directories. IF you want
to contribute to the development, but do not want to use CVS, you can always
contribute diff's from current file in CVS.
</p>

<p>If you are downloading sources from ftp(N/A at the moment), HTTP (N/A at the
moment), or jCVS servlet &quot;Download&quot; option, uncompress the downloaded
file in new directory you created for Aubit 4gl
</p>

<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">c)</span> Make sure you have <a href="http://www.iodbc.org" target="_blank">iODBC</a>
manager (you could possibly use direct linking of ODBC drivers or other
managers, but at the moment make files in distribution support only iODBC
manager, without need for modifications) and ODBC drivers for your database
installed and working. iODBC comes with little test program, 'odbctest'. Use it.
Initially we recommend <a href="http://www.openlinksw.com">OpenLink</a>  ODBC
drivers that are distributed with iODBC manager included.
</p>

<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">d)</span> Set your environment. Take a look at 'aubitenv' file in Aubit directory
you have created. Include a call to this file in /etc/profile, or other startup
scripts, so that your environment is set every time you log in. Don't forget
that to get this settings EXPORTED into your environment, you need to execute
the file with dot-space before file name, like &quot;. aubitenv&quot;
</p>

<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">e)</span> configure your .a4glrc defaults; they are used in the compiling of the
compiler, and later when the 4glpc script is invoked. Especially be careful to
point ODBC_LIB_DIR to location of your libiodbc.so file. That would for Openlink
be openlink_inst_dir/lib. The one in $AUBITDIR is read first. If you have one in
$HOME, it will override the one in $AUBITDIR
</p>

<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">f)</span> cd to $AUBITDIR; type 'make'; don't look at all this warnings, they are
not important at the moment.&nbsp;
</p>

<p><span style="background-color: #00FF00">g)</span> If your make process exited with message &quot;Aubit 4gl compiler is now
compiled&quot;,&nbsp;go to section &quot;Testing the installation&quot;. Please
be aware that to perform database related operations, you will need not only the
database engine installed, database created, and ODBC manager and ODBC driver
installed, but also configured 'odbc.ini' file appropriate for your database,
database engine and ODBC manager. You can use odbc.ini.example file in
&quot;test&quot; directory as example. This will unfortunately not eliminate the
need to read the documentation for this products.

<p><font color="#FF0000">Please not: the binary only distribution is not

</p>

<p>cd to the 'bin' directory and run ./install_4gl<br>
copy the a4glrc.sample to $HOME/.a4glrc<br>
</p>

<p>When your compiler is installed, read &quot;Testing the installation of
compiler&quot;
</p>

<p>Please see Aubit 4gl download page for available binary builds.
</p>

<p>I Plan to provide both tar.gz and RPM, and make this scriptable using main makefile, and stuff it in corn, so I can provide nightly
builds...

<p>cd to $AUBITDIR/test directory, and execute:
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4glpc hello.4gl -o hello
</p>

<p>You can now test form compiler with:
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fcompile form
</p>

<p>now, type:
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hello
</p>

<p>and you should see a little program with with three options in the menu on
the top:&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Hello test:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; window&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; form&nbsp;&nbsp; exit
</p>

<p>If you do, congratulations, you have just compiled your first 4gl program
using Aubit 4gl!
</p>

<p>There are few more test files there. Most important is hello_db.4gl, that is connecting
to the database. For it to compile and run, you will need to have a database,
and ODBC DSN configured.
