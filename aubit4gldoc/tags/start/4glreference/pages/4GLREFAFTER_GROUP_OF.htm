<B>AFTER GROUP OF
<P></P>
</B>The AFTER GROUP OF control block specifies the action that INFORMIX-4GL takes
after it processes a group of sorted records. Grouping is determined by the
ORDER BY specification in the SELECT statement or in the REPORT routine.

<B>statement</B> is a Report execution statement or other 4GL statement. 
<P></P>
<B><UL><LI>ariable</B> is the name of a variable from the list of arguments to the REPORT routine.
You must pass at least the value of variable through the arguments of the REPORT
routine.
<P></P>
</UL>A group of records is all of the input records that contain the same value for
the variable whose name follows the AFTER GROUP OF keywords. This group
variable must be passed through the report arguments. A report can include no more
than one AFTER GROUP OF control block for each group variable.
<P></P>
When 4GL executes the statements in a AFTER GROUP OF control block, local
variables have the values from the last record of the new group. From this
perspective, the AFTER GROUP OF control block could be thought of as the on last record
of group control block.
