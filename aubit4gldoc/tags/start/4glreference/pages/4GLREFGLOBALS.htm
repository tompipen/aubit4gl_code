</B>The GLOBALS statement declares modular variables that can be exported to other
program modules. It can also import variables from other modules.

<B>filename</B> is a quoted string that specifies the pathname of a file that contains the
GLOBALS . . . END GLOBALS statement (and optionally the DATABASE statement, but no
executable statement). The filename can include a pathname. The .4GL file
extension is required.
<P></P>
In general, a program variable is visible only in the same FUNCTION, MAIN, or
REPORT program block in which it was declared. To make its scope of reference
the entire source module, you must specify a modular declaration, by locating
the DEFINE statement outside of any program block.  
<P></P>
<B>To extend the visibility of one or more modular variables beyond the source
module in which they are declared, you must take the following steps:
<P></P>
</B>Declare the variable in a GLOBALS  . . . END GLOBALS declaration in a .4GL
file that contains only GLOBALS, DEFINE, and DATABASE statements.
<P></P>
Specify that file in GLOBALS &quot;filename&quot; statements in each additional source
module that includes statements referencing the variable.
<P></P>
These files must also be compiled and linked with the 4GL application.
