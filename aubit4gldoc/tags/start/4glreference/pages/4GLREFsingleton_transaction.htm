<B>singleton transaction
<P></P>
</B>A transaction that is made up of a single SQL statement. The transaction
automatically begins before each SQL statement which alters the database executes
and ends when this statement completes. If the single SQL statement fails, the
transaction is rolled back; otherwise it is committed. A database that is not
ANSI-compliant and which does not use transaction logging uses singleton
transactions.
