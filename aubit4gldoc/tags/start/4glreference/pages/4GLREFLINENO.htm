</B>The LINENO operator returns the number of the line within the page that is
currently printing. (This operator can appear only in the FORMAT section of a
REPORT program block.)

This returns the value of the line number of the report line that is currently
printing. 4GL computes the line number by calculating the number of lines from
the top of the current page, including the TOP MARGIN. 
<P></P>
INFORMIX-4GL cannot evaluate the LINENO operator outside the FORMAT section of
a REPORT program block. The value that LINENO returns must be assigned to a
variable that is not local to the report, if you need to reference this value
within some other program block of your 4GL application.
