</B>During or immediately after the INPUT ARRAY or DISPLAY ARRAY statement the
ARR_CURR( ) function returns the number of the program record within the program
array that is displayed in the current line of a screen array.

The current line of a screen array is the line that displays the screen cursor
at the beginning of a BEFORE ROW or AFTER ROW clause. 
<P></P>
The ARR_CURR( ) function returns an integer value. The first row of the
program array and the first line (that is, topmost) of the screen array are both
numbered 1. The built-in functions ARR_CURR( ) and SCR_LINE( ) can return different
values if the program array is larger than the screen array. 
<P></P>
You can pass ARR_CURR( ) as an argument when you call a function. In this way
the function receives as its argument the current record of whatever array is
referenced in the INPUT ARRAY or DISPLAY ARRAY statement. 
<P></P>
The ARR_CURR( ) function can be used to force a FOR loop to begin beyond the
first line of an array by setting a variable to ARR_CURR( ) and then using that
variable as the starting value for the FOR loop.
