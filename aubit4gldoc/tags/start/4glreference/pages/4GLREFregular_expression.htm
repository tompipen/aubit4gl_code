<B>regular expression
<P></P>
</B>A pattern used to match variable text. The elements of a regular expression
include: literal characters that must match exactly; the wildcard symbols--* to
mean one or more characters here and ? to mean any one character; and the
class--a list of characters (within brackets) that are acceptable. The MATCHES and
LIKE operators of SQL allow you to search for character strings that match to
regular expression patterns.
