<B>INTEGER
<P></P>
</B>The INTEGER data type stores whole numbers in a range from -2,147,483,647 to
+2,147,483,647. The negative number -2,147,483,648 is a reserved value that
cannot be used. INTEGER values are stored as signed four-byte binary integers, with
a scale of zero. This data type is typically used to stores counts,
quantities, categories coded as natural numbers, and the like.
<P></P>
Arithmetic operations on binary integers are typically without rounding error;
these operations and sort comparisons are performed more efficiently than on
FLOAT or DECIMAL data. INTEGER values, however, can only store data whose
absolute value is less than 2**31. Any fractional part of the value is discarded. If
a value exceeds this numeric range, neither 4GL nor the database engine can
store the data value as an INTEGER data type. 
<P></P>
Note: INTEGER variables can store SERIAL values from the database. If a user
inserts a new row into the database, 4GL automatically assigns the next whole
number in sequence to any field linked to a SERIAL column. Users do not need to
enter data into such fields. Once assigned, a SERIAL value cannot be changed.
