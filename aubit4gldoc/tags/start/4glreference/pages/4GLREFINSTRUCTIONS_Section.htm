<B>INSTRUCTIONS Section
<P></P>
</B>The INSTRUCTIONS section is the optional final section of a form specification
file. You can use this section to declare non-default screen records and
screen arrays. The INSTRUCTIONS section appears after the last field description (or
after the optional END keyword) of the <A HREF="4GLREFATTRIBUTES_Section.htm">ATTRIBUTES section</A>.

<P></P>
<B>array</B>  is the 4GL identifier for the screen array. (It is also the name of the screen
record that comprises each line of the array.)
<P></P>
<B>record</B> is the 4GL identifier that you declare for the screen record.  
<P></P>
<B>size</B>  is a literal integer, enclosed in square ( [ ] ) brackets, to specify the
number of screen records in the screen array.
<P></P>
<A NAME="2c9516bf"></A><B>Screen Records
<P></P>
</B>A screen record is a group of fields that screen-interaction statements of the
INFORMIX-4GL program can reference as a single object. By establishing a
correspondence between a set of screen fields (the screen record) and a set of 4GL
variables (typically a program record), you can pass values between the program
and the fields of the screen record. In many applications, it is convenient to
define a screen record that corresponds to a row of a database table.
<P></P>
<B>Default Screen Records
<P></P>
</B>INFORMIX-4GL recognizes default screen records that consist of all the screen
fields linked to the same database table within a given form. The Form Compiler
automatically creates a default record for each table that is used to
reference a field in the ATTRIBUTES Section. The components of the default record
correspond to the set of display fields that are linked to columns in that table.
<P></P>
The name of the default screen record is the table name (or the alias, if you
declared an <A HREF="4GLREFalias.htm">alias</A> for that table in the <A HREF="4GLREFTABLES_Section.htm">TABLES section</A>). For example, all the fields linked to columns of the customer table
constitute a default screen record whose name is customer. If a form includes one or
more FORMONLY fields, those fields comprise a default screen record called
formonly.
<P></P>
<B>Non-Default Screen Records
<P></P>
</B>The INSTRUCTIONS section of a form specification file can declare non-default
screen records. You use the SCREEN RECORD keywords of the INSTRUCTIONS section
to declare a name for the screen record, and to specify a list of fields that
are members of the screen record. A record declaration has this syntax

<P></P>
<B>first </B>is a field name that you declared in the ATTRIBUTES section.
<P></P>
<B>last </B>is a field name that you declared later than first.
<P></P>
<B>record </B>is the 4GL identifier that you declare for the screen record. 
<P></P>
<B>table reference</B> is a table name, alias, or synonym (or FORMONLY keyword). 
<P></P>
The field name is the SQL identifier of a database column linked to the field,
unless you specify FORMONLY as the table reference). 
<P></P>
The record name of a non-default screen record can have up to 50 characters,
and must comply with the rules for 4GL identifiers.
<P></P>
<A NAME="aa546c21"></A><B>Screen Arrays 
<P></P>
</B>A screen array is usually a repetitive array of fields in the screen layout,
each containing identical groups of screen fields. Each &quot;row&quot; of a screen array
is a screen record. Each &quot;column&quot; of a screen array consists of fields with the
same <A HREF="4GLREFfield_tag.htm">field tag</A> in the <A HREF="4GLREFSCREEN_Section.htm">SCREEN section</A> of the form specification file. 
<P></P>
You must declare screen arrays in the INSTRUCTIONS section, using syntax like
the syntax described for a screen record in the previous section, but with an
additional parameter to specify the number of screen records in the array:

<P></P>
<B>array</B> is the 4GL identifier for the screen array. (It is also the identifier of the
screen record that comprises each line of the array.)
<P></P>
<B>size</B> is a literal integer, enclosed in square ( [ ] ) brackets, to specify how many
screen records are in the screen array. 
<P></P>
The size should be the number of lines in the logical form where the set of
fields that comprise each screen record is repeated within the screen array.
