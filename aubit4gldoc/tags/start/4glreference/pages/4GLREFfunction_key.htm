<B>function key
<P></P>
</B>A key named F# where # is a number. Most DOS keyboards have functions keys F1
through F12. In 4GL, the developer can define actions to perform when the user
presses a certain function key. These actions are defined with the ON KEY
clause of the CONSTRUCT, DISPLAY ARRAY, INPUT, INPUT ARRAY, or PROMPT statement, or
in the KEY clause of the MENU statement. Here and in the OPTIONS statement, you
can use the notation F1 through F64 to denote the individual function keys
(but not all keyboards support that many function keys).
