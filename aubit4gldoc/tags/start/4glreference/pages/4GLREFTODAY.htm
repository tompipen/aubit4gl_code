TODAY is typically used in LET and PRINT statements to record the current date
in situations where the time of day (which CURRENT or TIME supplies) is not
necessary. Like the DATE, TIME, and CURRENT built-in operators, the effect of
TODAY is sensitive to the time of execution and the accuracy of the system
clock-calendar.
