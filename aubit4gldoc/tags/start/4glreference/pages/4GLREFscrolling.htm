<B>scrolling

</B>To move forward and back (or up and down) through a series of items. Referring
to a screen array, scrolling is the action of bringing invisible lines into
view. Displayed data can be scrolled either vertically (to bring different rows
into view) or horizontally (to show different columns). Referring to database
cursors, a sequential cursor can return only the current row and cannot return to
it; but a scroll cursor can fetch any row in the active set. Thus a scrolling
cursor can be used to implement a scrolling screen display.
