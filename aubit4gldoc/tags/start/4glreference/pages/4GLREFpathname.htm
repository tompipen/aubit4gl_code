</B>The list of directories needed to identify a file within a directory
hierarchy. In UNIX, directories of a pathname are separated by the slash ( / ) while in
DOS, they are separated with the backslash ( \ ). A file can be referred in two
ways: by its absolute pathname--all directories starting from the root (top)
of the directory hierarchy; by its relative pathname--the directories relative
to the current directory.
