<B>form specification file
<P></P>
</B>An ASCII source file that describes the logical format of the screen form and
provides instructions about how to display data values in the form at run time.
You define a screen form in its source file (with a .PER extension) and create
a compiled version (with a .FRM extension) for use at run time. The Form
Compiler creates the compiled version. Sometimes this file is referred to as simply
form specification.
