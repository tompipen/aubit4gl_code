<B>integer  </B>is the name of an INT or SMALLINT variable to receive a value derived from the
termination status code returned by the specified command. This value is
ignored in Windows, but its syntax is supported for compatibility with 4GL programs
developed for use on other operating system environments.

The RUN statement executes an operating system command line. You can even run
a second 4GL application as a secondary process, provided that only one of the
4GL applications accesses a database. When the command terminates, 4GL resumes
execution.
