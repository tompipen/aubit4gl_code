</B>The DECIMAL data type stores values as decimal numbers, up to 32 significant
digits. You can optionally specify the precision (the number of significant
digits) and the scale (the number of digits to the right of the decimal point). For
example, DECIMAL (14,2) specifies a total of 14 significant digits, two of
which describe the fractional part of the value.
<P></P>
When you specify both the precision and scale, the 4GL program can manipulate
the DECIMAL variable or constant with fixed-point arithmetic. 
<P></P>
If the data type declaration specifies neither the precision nor the scale,
the default is DECIMAL(16), a floating-point decimal with a precision of 16
digits. If you specify only one parameter, this is interpreted as the precision of a
floating-point number that can range in absolute value from 10**-128 to
10**126. 
<P></P>
The largest absolute value that you can store without an error in a DECIMAL
variable is 
<BR>10**p-s -10**-s. Here p is the precision, and s is the scale. Values with an
absolute value less than 0.5 x 10**-s are stored as zero. You cannot specify p
nor s for a FORMONLY DECIMAL field in a form; its precision is the smaller of 32
and (length - 2), where length is the field width in the screen layout.
<P></P>
DECIMAL (p,s) data types are useful for storing numbers with fractional parts
that must be calculated exactly, such as rates or percentages. Unless you are
developing a scientific or engineering application that explicitly controls for
measurement error, store floating-point numbers as DECIMAL(p,s) values.
<P></P>
When a user enters data in a SMALLFLOAT or FLOAT field, 4GL converts the
base-10 value to binary format for storage. Likewise, to display a FLOAT or
SMALLFLOAT number, 4GL reformats it from binary to base-10. Both conversions can lead
to inaccuracy. Thus, if a user enters 10.7 into a FLOAT field, it might actually
be stored as 10.699999 or as 10.700001, depending on the magnitude and the
sign of the binary-to-decimal conversion error. This limitation is a feature of
digital computers, rather than of 4GL.
