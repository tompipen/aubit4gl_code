<B>report</B>  is the name of a 4GL report, as declared in the REPORT statement.
<P></P>
You can use the FINISH REPORT statement to indicate the end of a report driver
and to complete processing of the report. FINISH REPORT must follow a START
REPORT statement, and at least one OUTPUT TO REPORT statement, that reference the
same report.
<P></P>
If the REPORT definition includes an ORDER BY section with no EXTERNAL
keyword, or specifies aggregates based on all the input records, 4GL makes two passes
through the input records. During the first pass, it uses the database engine
to sort the data, and then stores the sorted values in a temporary file. During
the second pass, it calculates any aggregate values, and produces output from
data in the temporary files.
<P></P>
<B>Executing the FINISH REPORT statement performs the following actions:
<P></P>
</B>Completes the second pass, if report is a two-pass report. These second pass
activities handle the calculation and output of any aggregate values that are
based on all the input records in the report, such as COUNT(*) or PERCENT(*) with
no GROUP qualifier.
<P></P>
Executes any AFTER GROUP OF control blocks.
<P></P>
Executes any PAGE HEADER, ON LAST ROW, and PAGE TRAILER control blocks needed
to complete the report.
<P></P>
Copies any data from the output buffers of the report to what START REPORT or
the report definition specified as the destination. If none was specified,
output goes to the Report window.
