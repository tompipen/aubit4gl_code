<B>error
<P></P>
</B>An exception that indicates failure of a requested action or an illegal
specification. Errors can occur during compilation--during preprocessing of program
statements or during the linking stage--or during execution of the program. At
run time, some errors are fatal in that the program cannot continue execution
(run-time errors); others are recoverable in that the program can take corrective
action and continue execution. Rounding errors can occur during truncation in
rounding; overflow errors can occur during arithmetic operations in which the
size of the result is larger than the size of the space in which the result is
to be stored.
