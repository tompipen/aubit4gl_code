<P></P>
<B>keyword</B> is one of the following keywords to specify a time unit: 
<P></P>
YEAR MONTH DAY
<BR>HOUR MINUTE SECOND FRACTION(n)
<P></P>
Here n is an integer, greater than zero but less than 6, to specify the scale
of the SECOND specification.
<P></P>
The UNITS operator returns an INTERVAL value for a single unit of time, such
as DAY TO DAY, YEAR TO YEAR, or HOUR TO HOUR. If you substitute a number
expression for the integer operand, any fractional part of the returned value is
discarded before the UNITS operator is applied.
<P></P>
The UNITS operator has a higher precedence than any arithmetic or Boolean
operator. You may need parentheses around its operand, if this is an expression
that includes other operators. Any left-hand arithmetic operand that includes the
UNITS operator must be enclosed within parentheses.
