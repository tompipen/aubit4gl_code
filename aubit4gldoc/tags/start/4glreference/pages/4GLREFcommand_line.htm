<B>command line
<P></P>
</B>A line of text typed by the user at the operating system prompt to run a
program. In a character-based environment, all programs are invoked by a command
line with optional command line arguments and options. Here is an example of a
command line with options set off by hyphens: W4GLCOMP -ANSI -A SPORTS.4GL In
graphical user interfaces, command line execution is often replaced with icons and
buttons. Some programs have both command line and graphical user interfaces.
