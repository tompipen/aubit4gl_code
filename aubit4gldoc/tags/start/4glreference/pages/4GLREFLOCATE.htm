<P></P>
<B>filename</B> is the name of a file in which to store the TEXT or BYTE value. This
specification can include a pathname and file extension. If the filename includes a
pathname that contains one or more backslash ( \ ) symbols, then you must use a
pair of backslashes ( \\ ) to represent each backslash. 
<P></P>
<B><UL><LI>ariable </B> is the name of a CHAR or VARCHAR variable containing a filename specification.
(This can also be a CHAR or VARCHAR member of a record, or element of an <A HREF="4GLREFarray00000023.htm">array</A>.)
<P></P>
</UL>The TEXT or BYTE variable that stores a large binary value is also called a <A HREF="4GLREFblob.htm">BLOB</A> (for Binary Large Object). You must specify whether you want to store the
value of the variable in memory or in a file. You can access a value from memory
faster than from a file. If your program exceeds the available memory, however,
4GL automatically stores part of the BLOB value in a file.
<P></P>
<B>To use a BLOB variable, your program must do the following:
<P></P>
</B><OL><LI> Declare the variable with a DEFINE statement.
<P></P>
<LI> Use the LOCATE statement to specify the storage location. The LOCATE statement
must appear within the scope of reference of the variable.

<B>array</B> is the name of a structured variable of the ARRAY data type.
<P></P>
<B>first  </B>is the name of a large member variable to be initialized. 
<P></P>
<B>integer</B> is a literal integer between 0 and the declared size of the array.
<P></P>
<B>last </B>is another member of record that was declared later than first.
<P></P>
<B>record</B> is the name of a structured variable of the RECORD data type.
<P></P>
<B><UL><LI>ariable </B> is the name of a large variable of the TEXT or BYTE data type that was
declared in a previous DEFINE statement.
