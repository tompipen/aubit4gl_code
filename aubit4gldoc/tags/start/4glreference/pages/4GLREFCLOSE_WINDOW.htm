<B>window</B> is the identifier of the 4GL window to be closed.
<P></P>
<B>The CLOSE WINDOW statement causes 4GL to take the following actions:
<P></P>
</B>Clears the specified 4GL window from the <A HREF="4GLREFApplication_window.htm">Application window</A>, and restores any underlying display.
<P></P>
Frees all resources used by the 4GL window, and deletes it from the 4GL window
stack.
<P></P>
If the OPEN WINDOW statement included the WITH FORM clause, the CLOSE WINDOW
statement closes both the form and the 4GL window.
<P></P>
4GL maintains an ordered list of open 4GL windows, called the window stack.
When you open a new 4GL window, the new window is added to the stack and becomes
the current window, meaning that it occupies the top of the stack. If you close
the current window, the next 4GL window on the stack becomes the new current
window. If you close any other window, 4GL deletes it from the window stack,
leaving the current window unchanged. 
<P></P>
Closing a window has no effect on values of variables that were set while the
window was open.
