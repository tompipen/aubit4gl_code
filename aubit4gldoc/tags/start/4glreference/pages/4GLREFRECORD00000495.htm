<B>RECORD
<P></P>
</B>The RECORD data type stores an ordered set of values. Within each of these
sets (called a program record), the values can be of any 4GL data type, or any
combination of data types in a fixed order, including the simple data types, large
binary (BYTE, TEXT) data types, and structured data types (ARRAY, RECORD). A
component variable in a record is called a member.

This is the data-type declaration syntax for RECORD variables:.

<B>member</B> is a name that you declare for a member variable of the record.
<P></P>
<B>table </B> is the SQL identifier of a database table, synonym, or view.
<P></P>
The LIKE keyword declares a member variable that has the same data type as
some column of a database table. If you substitute an asterisk ( * ) symbol for
the column specification, the record has members with the same identifiers as the
columns in table, and 4GL data types that correspond to the fixed sequence of
SQL data types in an entire row of the table. (Any SERIAL column in table
corresponds to a record member of data type INTEGER.)
