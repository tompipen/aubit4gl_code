<B>DATE
<P></P>
</B>The DATE data type stores calendar dates. A calendar date is stored internally
as an integer that evaluates to the number of days since December 31, 1899. 
<P></P>
The default display format of a DATE value is:
<P></P>
<B>mm/dd/yyyy
<P></P>
</B>for mm a month (1 to 12), dd a day of the month (1 to 31), and yyyy a year
(0001 to 9999). The DBDATE environment variable can change the separator symbol
and the default order of day, month, and year time units. The FORMAT attribute
specifies DATE display formats in forms. For month, 4GL accepts the value 1 or 01
for January, 2 or 02 for February, and so on. For days, it accepts a value 1
or 01 for the first day of the month, 2 or 02 for the second, and so on, up to
the maximum number of days in a given month.
<P></P>
If the user of your application enters from the keyboard a two-digit value for
the year, as in 89 or 93, then 4GL assumes that the year is in the range
1900-1999, and assigns 1 and 9 as the first two digits (19) of the year. (Users must
pad the year value with one or two leading zeros to specify years in the First
Century; for example, 093 or 0093 for the year 93 A.D.)
<P></P>
Because DATE values are stored as integers in the range 693,594 to 2,958,464,
you can use them in arithmetic expressions, such as the difference between two
DATE values. The result, a positive or negative INT value, is the number of
days that have elapsed between the two dates. The UNITS DAY operator can convert
this to an INTERVAL. (The use of DATE operands in division, multiplication, or
exponentiation cannot produce meaningful results.)
