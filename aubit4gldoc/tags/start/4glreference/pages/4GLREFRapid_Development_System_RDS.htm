<B>Rapid Development System (RDS)
<P></P>
</B>One of two implementations of the 4GL application development language for
UNIX systems. The RDS compiler produces p-code that can then be executed by a
runner. The other implementation of 4GL for UNIX systems is the C Compiler Version;
it uses preprocessors to generate C code, which is then compiled and linked to
make a standalone, executable file. 4GL for Windows includes both the p-code
compiler/runner and the C code compiler.
