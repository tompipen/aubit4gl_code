<B>associativity
<P></P>
</B>The principle that determines the order in which operands at the same level of
precedence in an expression are evaluated. For example, to evaluate the
expression a - b + c, 4GL first evaluates a - b and then adds c to the result because
binary arithmetic operators associate to the left.
