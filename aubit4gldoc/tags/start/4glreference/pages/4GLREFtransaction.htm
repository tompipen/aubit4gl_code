<B>transaction
<P></P>
</B>A collection of one or more SQL statements that must be treated as a single
unit of work. The SQL statements within the transaction must all be successful
for the transaction to succeed. If one of the statements in a transaction fails,
the entire transaction can be rolled back (canceled). If the transaction is
successful, the work is committed and all changes to the database from the
transaction are accepted. The transaction log contains the changes made to the
database during a transaction. If a database is not ANSI-compliant, it uses singleton
transactions if it does not use a transaction log and it uses explicit
transactions otherwise. If a database is ANSI-compliant, it uses implicit transactions.
