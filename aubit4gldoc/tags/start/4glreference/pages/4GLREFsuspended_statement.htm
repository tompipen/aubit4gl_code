<B>suspended statement
<P></P>
</B>The statement being executed or about to be executed by the 4GL application
when execution was suspended. You can control execution by running the program
with the INFORMIX-4GL Interactive Debugger. After a breakpoint or after stepping
through statements, the suspended statement is the next statement that the 4GL
application will execute. The suspended statement must reside in an accessible
function. If the 4GL application is currently executing an inaccessible
function, the suspended statement is the call to the inaccessible function.
