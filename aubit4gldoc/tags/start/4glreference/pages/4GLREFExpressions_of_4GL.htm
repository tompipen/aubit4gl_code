<B>Expressions of 4GL
<P></P>
</B>A 4GL expression is a sequence of operands, operators, and parentheses that
INFORMIX-4GL can evaluate as a single value. 
<P></P>

Statements, functions, form specifications, operators, and expressions can
have expressions as arguments, components, or operands.  The context where an
expression appears, as well as its syntax, determines the data type of its returned
value. It is convenient to classify 4GL expressions into the following five
categories, based on the data type of what they return: 
<P></P>
<B>Boolean </B>a value that is either TRUE or FALSE or NULL
<P></P>
<B>Integer </B>a whole-number value of data type INT or SMALLINT
<P></P>
<B>Number </B>a value of any number data type
<P></P>
<B>Character</B> a character string of data type CHAR or VARCHAR
<P></P>
<B>Time </B>a value of data type DATE, DATETIME, or INTERVAL
<P></P>
If the term 4GL expression is not qualified as one of these five specific data
types, then the expression can be any of these data types.
<P></P>
As the diagram suggests, 4GL Boolean expressions are special cases of integer
expressions, and integer expressions are a logical subset of number
expressions. You can substitute a 4GL Boolean or integer expression where a number
expression is valid (unless this results in an attempt to divide by zero).
<P></P>
<B>Named Values as Operands
<P></P>
</B>A 4GL expression can include the name of a variable of any simple data type or
the constants TRUE or FALSE. The variable can also be a simple member of a
record, or a simple element of an array:

<P></P>
<B>Function Calls as Operands
<P></P>
</B>A 4GL expression can include calls to functions that return exactly one value:
<P></P>

<P></P>
<B>function</B> is the name of a function. The parentheses are required, regardless of whether
the function takes any arguments.
<P></P>
The function can be a programmer-defined or built-in function, provided that
it returns a single value of a data type that is valid in the expression.
(Function calls as arguments can return multiple values.)
