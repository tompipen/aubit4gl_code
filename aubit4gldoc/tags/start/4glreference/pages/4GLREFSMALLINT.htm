</B>The SMALLINT data type stores data as signed two-byte binary integers.
<P></P>
Values must be whole numbers within the range from -32,767 to +32,767. 
<P></P>
Any fractional part of the data value is discarded. If a value lies outside
this range, you cannot store it in a SMALLINT variable or database column. (The
negative value -32,768 is reserved; it cannot be assigned to a SMALLINT
variable, constant, or database column, nor entered into a SMALLINT field.)
<P></P>
You can use SMALLINT variables, constants, and FORMONLY fields of screen forms
to store, manipulate, and display data that can be represented as whole
numbers of an absolute value less than 2**15. This data type typically stores small
whole numbers, Boolean values, ranks, 4-digit codes, or measurements that
classify data into a small number of numerically-coded categories. Since a SMALLINT
data type requires only 2 bytes of storage, arithmetic operations in number
expressions can be done very efficiently, provided that the values of the operands
lie within the somewhat limited range of SMALLINT values.
