</B>Descriptive information put in a source file to explain the files contents.
Comments are introduced with special symbols to notify the compiler that
subsequent text can be ignored. In 4GL source modules, comments can be introduced by
putting the left brace ( { ) in the first position of the source file line to
open a comment. You must then also include a right brace ( } ) anywhere on a line
to close the comment. To put a comment on the same line as code, precede the
comment with a double-hyphen ( -- ) or the # symbol. In 4GL form specification
files, comments can be introduced with braces and the double-hyphen; the initial
# symbol is not valid.
