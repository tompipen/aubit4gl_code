<B>mouse bar
<P></P>
</B>An optional section of the Application window. By default it is located to the
right of the display area. However, this location can be customized with
command line options to the P-code Runner. The mouse bar contains buttons that
display icons rather than titles. These buttons duplicate the effects of 4GL logical
keys: the Accept button, Cancel button, and Help button. The mouse bar also
includes a transient Hourglass icon while waiting for the termination of a
secondary process started with a RUN statement.
