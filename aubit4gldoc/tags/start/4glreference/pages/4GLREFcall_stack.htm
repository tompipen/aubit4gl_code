<B>call stack
<P></P>
</B>A stack used by 4GL at run time to keep track of active functions. An active
function is one that has been called but that has not yet returned. Each time
the program calls a function, the functions state is pushed onto the call stack.
When a function exits, the state is popped off the call stack. The MAIN program
block is always at the bottom of this stack. You can examine the call stack
within the 4GL Debuggers.
