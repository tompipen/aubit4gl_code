<B>resuming execution
<P></P>
</B>Continuing to execute a 4GL application after it has been suspended. You can
control execution by running the program with the INFORMIX-4GL Interactive
Debugger. Within the Debugger, you can resume execution indefinitely or for a fixed
number of lines of code. The 4GL SLEEP statement suspends execution for a
specified amount of time, automatically resuming after this time. Execution resumes
after a 4GL user interaction statement when the user enters some key sequence.
